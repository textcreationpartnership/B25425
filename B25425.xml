            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THou haſt here a Multitude of <hi>Scripture-Metaphors, Types, Similies,</hi> and other <hi>borrowed Terms,</hi> opened, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally improved, which ('tis hoped) may tend to the Advantage of all who love to read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and long after Knowledg, either Natural or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. The wiſeſt of Men tells us, that the great Leſſon his Father taught him, was to get Wiſdom and Underſtanding, becauſe 'tis the principal Thing. Where to find this invaluable Jewel, we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Son of God, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 5.39.</note> as the great Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> How to obtain it, we are elſewhere told, <hi>We muſt ask it of God, who giveth liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given to us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 1.5.</note> In a word, <hi>It is to be cried after, ſought as Silver,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 2.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>and ſearched for as hid Treaſures.</hi> He who ſincerely giveth up himſelf to frequent Prayer and Meditation, and reſolves to be in the continual Purſuit of this chief of Bleſſings, may aſſure himſelf of Succeſs, having the Promiſe of a faithful God, who cannot lie, for his Security. The Means are plain, and the Encouragement great, beyond compariſon: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Intereſt of every Chriſtian to converſe with the Word of God, in order to obtain a Purchaſe ſo eminently dignified with the Title of <hi>Principal Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Age ſince the Infancy of Chriſtianity had greater Advantage to arrive at Scripture-Knowledge than we enjoy; nor does the Light of the Goſpel ſhine with more eminent Luſtre in any Nation, than in <hi>England</hi> at this time, (which cauſes Satan, and his <hi>Helliſh Emiſſaries,</hi> to ſtrive to darken or eclipſe its Glory, by introducing Popery, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and Error amongſt us.) <hi>England,</hi> and particularly its famous <hi>Metropolis,</hi> is the very Butt of Antichriſtian Spite and Fury, becauſe it is indeed thought to be the main Bulwark of the true Proteſtant Religion throughout the World. We have the Scriptures tranſlated in our Mother-Tongue, which the ſacrilegious Adverſaries of <hi>Truth</hi> lock'd up in Languages unknown to the Vulgar. We have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Expoſitions of the Learned, inſtead of the peſtilent and
<pb facs="tcp:39531:3"/> 
               <hi>Heretical</hi> Gloſſes of <hi>Rome;</hi> we have ſtill, notwithſtanding all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of the Enemies of the Goſpel, a painful, powerful, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Miniſtry. And if we improve not all theſe Mercies to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this divine and ſublime Knowledg, how inexcuſable ſhall we be, and how juſt in God, ſhould he in one day deprive us of all?</p>
            <p>It was ſaid by the Learned <hi>Illyricus, In ſacris Literis ampliſſimus &amp; inſtructiſſimus Theſaurus paratus est,— ut nos inde omnia nobis neceſſaria, ac ſalutoria Remedia hauriamus:</hi> In the holy Scriptures a vaſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Treaſure is provided, from whence we may be furniſhed with whatſoever is neceſſary and wholeſom. Here is a large Field of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Employment. <hi>I adore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian, the Fulneſs of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> What a vaſt Number of <hi>Commentaries, Expoſitions,</hi> and <hi>Elucidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are extant! yea, one ſingle Verſe affords a moſt learned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copious Theme for a whole Volume; yet there's Work enough ſtill left, and the learned and profitable Labours of thoſe eminent Worthies that have gone before us, do not prohibit the Additions of ſubſequent Ages, nor render them unneceſſary. All ſorts of Knowledg are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, and that which is divine, calls for the moſt earneſt and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous purſuit, becauſe all other Sciences are vain and uſeleſs without it; and is comprehenſive (in as much as it gives a full Diſcovery of Chriſt) of what is neceſſary to Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 5.8. This renders it univerſally good; and Good is communicative. It is a Talent that calls for Improvement, to the Profit of Communities. It is called <hi>Light,</hi> the Nature of which is perfectly diffuſive of its Radiance, and bright Illuſtrations; and 'tis not to be put under a Buſhel, but in a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick, to enlighten the whole Houſe. Every Chriſtian is to improve and ſtir up the Gift that is in him: And tho a <hi>Work</hi> be not done ſo well by one Man, as it might by another, who hath greater <hi>Accompliſhments,</hi> (were it ſet upon his Heart to undertake it) yet may the Profit to ſome Souls countervail the Labour, and the Whole bleſs the World more, than not to have it done at all: Beſides, what Man, in this nice and cenſorious Age, can give Content to all?</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations ſeemed ſo weighty, as to incline me to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome of that Time and Talent the Lord hath entruſted me with, to compleat this Work.</p>
            <p>'Tis obvious to every one's Obſervation, that the Holy Scripture abounds with <hi>Metaphors, Allegories,</hi> and other <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of Speech. Similitudes are borrowed from Viſible Things, to ſet forth and illuſtrate the excellent Nature of Inviſible Things; yea, heavenly Things are often called by the very Names that material or earthly Things are called, which is not to obſcure or hide the meaning of them from us, but to accommodate them to our Underſtanding; God by a gracious <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Condeſcenſion, conveying the Knowledg of Himſelf, and ſpiritual Things, by preaching them by their reſpective
<pb facs="tcp:39531:3"/> earthly Similitudes, <hi>&amp;c. If I have told you of earthly Things, and ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not; how ſhall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly Things?</hi> John 3.12. And tho the Stile of the Holy Scripture is not varniſh'd with that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of ſuperficial Ornament, that jingling Cadency of Sounds, and Fancy-pleaſing Trifles, as the pompous Oratory of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> is beautified with; yet it has Qualities far more excellent: 'Tis grave and maſculine; it hath a magnificent, commanding Elegance, peculiar to it ſelf, ſuitable to the lofty Things it treats of, which no other Writing can imitate; reaching the inner Rooms of the Soul, and ſtirring up Affections, in ſo ſpiritual and ſublime a kind, as the artificial Bravery of <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s Elocution, could never do. There are Myſteries, which Nature, as ſuch, (however adorned with Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Notions, or Metaphyſical Speculations,) cannot comprehend: They are like the Waters of the Sanctuary, where a Lamb may wade, and an Elephant may ſwim: A weak Chriſtian that is gracious, may go through, were the unſanctified Schoolman may be plunged and overwhelmed: They are ſo plain and eaſy, that a Babe in Chriſt may underſtand them; and ſome Places ſo difficult, as to find Work for the utmoſt Study and Inquiſition of the moſt knowing.</p>
            <p>This is the Second, and Laſt Volume, and perfects our whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which I thought at firſt might have came into one entire Book. That which was promiſed at firſt, concerning the Divine Authority of the Scripture, and the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> you will find here. And tho there is one Thing omitted, or left out, which was in the <hi>Specimen,</hi> viz. <hi>Demonſtrations touching the Validity of our Tranſlation,</hi> which we lately found done ſome time ſince by the Learned Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and others: Yet you have in the room of it a <hi>Treatiſe of Types,</hi> which I am perſuaded will be more acceptable to moſt Men, and hath been much more laborious and chargeable to compleat, it containing divers Sheets. A Treatiſe of Types under the Law, carefully opened, we have ground to believe, will be very ſerviceable, eſpecially to thoſe in the Miniſtry: And ſuch hath been my Care, that I have not run one Parallel concerning Types, but what I have had the Opinion of the moſt learned <hi>Typical</hi> Writers upon; ſo that I readily confeſs, 'tis rather theirs than mine.</p>
            <p>And tho there is a great difference between <hi>Metaphorical</hi> or <hi>Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and <hi>Typical</hi> Scriptures; yet we thought an Eſſay to open the moſt eminent <hi>Types</hi> found in the <hi>Old-Teſtament,</hi> would well ſuit with this ſublime Subject: And becauſe ſome, for want of Study or Learning, may not readily underſtand the Difference that is between them, we will give you here the Sence of the Learned upon it,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is <hi>Allegorical</hi> and <hi>Typical,</hi> (we take <hi>Allegory</hi> here as Divines do, who take it not as <hi>Grammarians</hi> or <hi>Rhetoricians,</hi> for a continued Diſcourſe of many Figures together) <hi>properly,</hi> or <hi>ſtrictly</hi> taken: For ſometimes an Allegory may be taken largely, and ſo may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb facs="tcp:39531:4"/> whatſoever is figurative, whether Typical, Tropological, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Apoſtle hath it in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s two Sons, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> which is yet properly a Type, differeth from Types, or Typical Scripture, thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Types ſuppoſe ſtill the Verity of ſome Hiſtory, as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s being three Days and three Nights in the Fiſhes Belly; when it is applied to Chriſt in the New Teſtament, it ſuppoſeth ſuch a thing was once done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Allegories again have no ſuch neceſſary Suppoſition, but are as Parables, propounded for ſome myſtical End. Thus whilſt it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. <hi>A certain King made a Marriage for his Son, planted a Vineyard,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe Places ſuppoſe it not neceſſary as to the being of the Allegory, that ever ſuch a thing was; but a Type cannot be without reality in the thing, as Fact, which is made a Type.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Types look only to Matter of Fact, and compare one Fact with another, (as Chriſt being ſlain, and lying three Days in the Grave, to the Paſchal Lamb, and <hi>Jonah's</hi> lying ſo long in the Whale's Belly): But Allegories take in Words, Sentences, Doctrines, both of Faith and Manners, as in the former Example is clear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Types compare Perſons and Facts under the Old-Teſtament, with Perſons and Facts under the New, and is made up of ſomething that is preſent, prefiguring another to come: Allegories look eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Matters in hand, and intend the explaining ſome hidden and myſtical Sence upon the Words, which at preſent they ſeem not to bear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Types are only Hiſtorical, as ſuch; and the Truth of Fact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the Antitype makes them up: it being clear in Scripture, that ſuch things are Types; for we muſt not forge Types without Scripture-Warrant: But Allegories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are principally Doctrinal, and in their Scope intend not to clear or compare Facts, but to hold forth and explain Doctrines, or by ſuch Similitudes to illuſtrate, and make them the better underſtood, and to move and affect the Heart the more, or the more forcibly to convince the Conſcience; as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> made uſe of a Parable, when he was about to convince <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Types in the Old-Teſtament reſpect only ſome Things, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Events; as Chriſt, the Goſpel, and the ſpreading thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and cannot be extended beyond theſe: But Allegories, Similitudes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take in every thing, that belongs either to Doctrine, or Inſtruction in Faith, or Practice, for ordering of one's Life. Hence, according to the Judgment of the Learned, Metaphors, Allegories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more extenſive and comprehenſive in their Meaning and Application, than Types; tho 'tis not denied, but that care ought to be had that they be not run beyond the <hi>Analogy of Faith;</hi> and many times it behoveth to ſee we go not beyond the Scope of the Text, which plainly ſhews the whole Mind of the Spirit, in making uſe of ſuch Similitudes, for
<pb facs="tcp:39531:4"/> Illuſtration ſake; and we hope we have kept within a due compaſs in this reſpect, and avoided whatever may give <hi>juſt cauſe of Offence</hi> to any.</p>
            <p>You had in the <hi>Firſt Volume</hi> a Treatiſe of <hi>Tropes,</hi> reduced under their proper Heads; and here you have the <hi>Schemes</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> in Scripture handled after the ſame manner. And becauſe there is ſome difficulty to underſtand <hi>Allegorical</hi> Scriptures, or to know what Places are to be taken <hi>metaphorically,</hi> we ſhall ſhew,<note place="margin">See, Key to <hi>Clavis Cantic.</hi>
               </note> (as 'tis noted by the Learned) 1. What an <hi>Allegory</hi> or <hi>figurative</hi> Scripture is. 2. When 'tis neceſſary to underſtand a Scripture <hi>figuratively,</hi> or in an <hi>Allegorick</hi> Sence.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, there is a great difference betwixt an <hi>Allegorick</hi> Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Scripture, and an Expoſition of <hi>Allegorick</hi> Scripture: The firſt is that which the Fathers and School-men fail in, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorize plain Scriptures and Hiſtories, ſeeking to draw out ſome ſecret meaning, other than appears in the Words, and ſo would faſten many Senſes upon one Scripture. This is indeed unſafe, and is juſtly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable; for this makes clear Scripture dark, and obtrudes Meanings on the Words never intended by the Spirit: As ſuppoſe one ſpeaking of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Combat with <hi>David,</hi> ſhould paſs by the <hi>Letter,</hi> and expound <hi>Goliah</hi> to be the Fleſh, or the Devil; and <hi>David,</hi> to mean the Spirit or Chriſt. Such Expoſitions may have ſome pleaſantneſs, but very little ſolidity; and ſuch who commonly thus interpret Scripture, often fall into Errors, and guilty of this Fault <hi>Origen</hi> is thought to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, An Expoſition of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llegorical</hi> Scripture is the opening and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of ſome dark Scripture, (wherein the Mind of the Spirit is couched and hid under Figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) making it plain and edifying, by bringing out the Sence according to the meaning of the Holy Spirit in the place, tho at firſt it ſeems to bear no ſuch thing. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. Chriſt expounds that Parable or Allegory, (for tho <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Metaphors, Similes, Parables,</hi> and <hi>Allegories,</hi> yet in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity there is none, but that <hi>Allegories</hi> are more large and continued) calling the <hi>Seed</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Sower</hi> the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> &amp;c. This way of expounding ſuch dark Scriptures is both uſeful and neceſſary, and was often uſed as edifying by our Lord Jeſus to his Diſciples. Now 'tis this we ſpeak of, which teacheth how to draw <hi>plain Doctrines</hi> out of <hi>Metaphors, Allegories,</hi> &amp;c. and not to draw <hi>Allegories</hi> out of <hi>plain Hiſtories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it may be asked, <hi>When we are to account a Place of Scripture figurative or allegorick, and ſeek ſome other meaning than what at firſt appears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When the literal proper meaning looks abſurd-like, or is empty, nothing to Edification; as when 'tis ſaid, <hi>Unleſs ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo thoſe Scriptures that command to <hi>pluck out the right Eye,</hi> and <hi>cut off the right Hand, take up our Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. All which, if literally underſtood, were abſurd and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; and therefore the miſtaking ſuch <hi>Scriptures,</hi> hath occaſioned many <hi>grievous Errors,</hi> as that of the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> attributing <hi>Members
<pb facs="tcp:39531:5"/> viz.</hi> Head, Hands, Feet, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> to God; and <hi>Paſſions,</hi> yea, <hi>Infirmities,</hi> as Anger, Repenting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in ſuch places, ſpeaking after the manner of Men, <hi>metaphorically</hi> attribute ſuch things to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe Places of <hi>Scripture</hi> are to be accounted <hi>Metaphorical</hi> or <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorick,</hi> which reach not the <hi>Scope of Edification</hi> intended by them, if lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally underſtood; as, when Chriſt ſpoke of <hi>Sowing, Mat.</hi> 13. the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thought, ſomething more was intended than at firſt appeared, for his Aim could not be to diſcourſe of Husbandry to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When a <hi>literal Sence</hi> would obtrude ſome Falſity on the <hi>Scripture,</hi> then ſuch Places are to be taken <hi>Allegorically;</hi> as when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this Temple, and I will build it up again in three Days:</hi> Which if under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Material Temple,</hi> Chriſt's Words would not have had their Accompliſhment; But he ſpoke, <hi>figuratively,</hi> of his Body. So when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except a Man eat my Fleſh, and drink my Blood, he cannot live;</hi> it cannot be underſtood literally, becauſe many who have obtained Life, never did ſo eat his Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Any <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be accounted <hi>Figurative</hi> or <hi>Allegorical,</hi> when the <hi>literal Sence</hi> agrees not with other <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and is repugnant to the Analogy of Faith, or Rules of good Manners; as when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to <hi>heap Coals of Fire upon the Head of our Enemy;</hi> now we being required not to avenge our ſelves, it followeth clearly, this <hi>Scripture</hi> is not properly or literally underſtood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When a <hi>literal Sence</hi> anſwers not to the preſent Scope of the Speaker, and the Speaker would be thought impertinent, if his Words were properly taken; then it ought to be expounded in a figurative Sence. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. when <hi>John</hi> is preſſing Repentance, he ſaith, <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the Root of the Tree,</hi> &amp;c. And the Parable of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.7. If theſe Places were only properly to be underſtood, they would not enforce Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> had we not had good Encouragement from divers worthy Miniſters in this City, this, as well as the former, had never ſeen the Sun; but the readineſs of divers Perſons, upon the coming out of the Firſt, to ſubſcribe for this, hath midwiv'd it into the World, where we expect it will meet with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Entertainment; but I hope by this time, through the Grace of God, I have learned not to be concerned, either about the Praiſe of ſome on the one hand, or Diſpraiſe and Contempt of others, on the other hand: not doubting, but that this, or the ſucceeding Age, may receive Advantage by it, and many bleſs God for it: And if it bring Glory to God, and Profit to his Church, I have my chief End, and ſhall be content, tho I paſs under the Cenſures of captious Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt confeſs, it is not all of my own compiling; I have made uſe of ſome help from others, partly to expedite the Work, and partly for want of ſome Literature. And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> that I may not retain thee longer at the Door, I ſhall commit Thee and the Work to the Bleſſing of the Lord, heartily begging an Intereſt in thy Prayers, engaging not to forget thee in this evil and perilous Hour, ſubſcribe my ſelf,</hi>

For tho it be commonly own'd by Chriſtians to be the Word of God, yet ſince on the one Hand, there are (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this Atheiſtical Age) too many amongſt us, whoſe Love of Sin, and Reſolutions to continue therein, tempt them to ſeek for ſhelter in bold Contempt of, or ſubtile Cavils againſt thoſe <hi>Heavenly Oracles;</hi> and on the other hand, not a few poor Souls are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhaken with <hi>Temptations,</hi> and know not how to diſcharge themſelves from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Queſtions that they are often attaqued with, touching the Divine Original and Authority of thoſe Sacred Records; Not ſo much for want of <hi>Aſſent</hi> thereunto, as of a right Underſtanding or Conſideration of the <hi>Grounds</hi> of that Aſſent, and the true formal Reaſon thereof; Therefore that with a perfect Security to our preſent and future Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, we may rely on that Book, as the infallible Store-houſe of Heavenly Verities, that great and <hi>only Revelation,</hi> whereby God does <hi>Inform, Rule,</hi> and will <hi>Judg</hi> the World; we ſhall ſet forth ſome Conſiderations evincing this moſt important Truth: But finding that divers able and worthy Men have of late wrote moſt learnedly and excellently upon this Subject, we ſhall upon that account be the more conciſe; and tho we have ſaid but <hi>little,</hi> yet we hope <hi>enough</hi> to ſatisfy any rational conſidering Man, and confute the vain Cavils of the Adverſary; for all along in <hi>this Eſſay</hi> we ſtrive to join <hi>Perſpicuity</hi> with <hi>Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and to ſpeak ſo plainly and familiarly, that the weakeſt Capacity may with eaſe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it up; (the neglect hereof having rendred the Labours of ſome others on the ſame Subject leſs ſerviceable to the vulgar unlearned Reader.) It being our great Deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the Help and Eſtabliſhment of the Unskilful, and to aſſiſt weak Chriſtians; knowing, that if Satan can once bring them into a diffidence of the Truth and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God's Word, he at the ſame Inſtant ſhakes the very Foundation of all their Hope and Religion: <hi>And if the Foundations fail, what ſhall the Righteous do?</hi> Pſal. 11.3.</p>

Euſebius</hi> alſo, who followed <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> at about two hundred Years diſtance, in the 2d and 3d Books of his <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Preparation,</hi> proſecutes the ſame Argument at large, and from abundance of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Confeſſions, out of the beſt and moſt authentick Heathen Authors themſelves, undeniably evinces, That <hi>Moſes</hi> was the moſt ancient of all the Writers that were known or named amongſt them. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſo confidently upbraids the Gentiles in this matter, that we think it not amiſs to recite his Words, in the 19th Chapter of his Apology. — <hi>Our Religion</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking to the Heathens,) <hi>far out-does all that you can boaſt of in that kind: For the Books of one of our Prophets only,</hi> viz. Moſes, <hi>(wherein it ſeems God hath encloſed, as in a Treaſury, all the Chriſtian Religion preceding ſo many Ages together) reach beyond the ancienteſt you have, even all your Publick Monuments, the Antiquity of your Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, the Eſtabliſhment of your Eſtates, the Foundations of your Cities, all that are moſt advanced by you in all Ages of Hiſtory, and Memory of Times; the Invention even of the Characters, which are Interpreters of Sciences, and the Guardians of all Things excellent: I think I may ſay more, they are elder than your very Gods, your Temples, Oracles, and Sacrifices. Have you not heard mention made of that great Prophet,</hi> Moſes? <hi>He was contemporary with</hi> Inachus, <hi>and preceded</hi> Danaus, <hi>(the ancienteſt of all that have a Name in your Hiſtories)</hi> 393 <hi>Years: He lived ſome Hundreds of Years before the Ruine of</hi> Troy.

                  </p>
                  <p>So that 'tis a Thing out of diſpute, that for Antiquity, neither the Writings of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> or <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Beroſus,</hi> nor any other, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> Theſe <hi>Gray-Hairs</hi> ſhew them to be the Off-ſpring of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of Days;</hi> for Truth is always the Firſt-born.</p>
                  <p>And if we conſider, how low, mean, and imperfect all humane Inventions were in thoſe Times; and what fooliſh, irrational, and abſurd Conceptions, both the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> (Nations moſt celebrated for Wiſdom) had of Things Divine, and the Duty and Happineſs of Man; we cannot but conclude, That ſo clear an Account of the World's Beginning, Depravation, Deſtruction by the Flood, and Re-peopling; ſuch a moſt excellent Law and Doctrine, in reference both to God and Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could not be of <hi>Humane Extract,</hi> but muſt needs be in truth, what it pretends it ſelf to be, a <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> Beſides, who can believe the <hi>firſt</hi> Religion ſhould be the worſt, or the moſt timely Notions of God the falſeſt? Were this ſo, and the Bible not a <hi>Divine</hi> Book, but compoſed by <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> then it follows, That the moſt primitive Account we have of Religion is counterfeit; that the Devil ſet up his Chappel, before God built his Church; that in the earlieſt Notices we have of God, of the World's Original, Man's Fall, and the Way of his Recovery, the World is <hi>deceived</hi> and <hi>abuſed;</hi> and that God ſuffered the Devil, in the firſt place, (and without any Thing publickly extant from him, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince, to contradict it) in his Name, and under pretence of his Authority, to delude and miſlead Mankind, with a falſe Account of all thoſe Things which they are moſt concerned to know, and upon the right Knowledg of which their preſent and future Happineſs depends: All which, as it is unworthy of God, ſo it is no leſs repugnant to the Dictates of Reaſon.

<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:39531:9"/> when he came to ſtudy the ſacred Scriptures, vilifies all Ornaments of Literature amongſt the Greek Philoſophers, as infinitely below thoſe Divine Oracles. <hi>Illyricus</hi> ſays, That altho we find not in the Holy Scripture that idle or delicate Itch of Words, that external Sweetneſs or Allurement, that Numeroſity of Sounds, or thoſe pleaſing Triffes, which vain-glorious Orators of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> beautified their ſo much fam'd Harangues with; yet we find there a grave and maſculine Eloquence, exceeding all others.

The more plain therefore the Word and Law of the great God is, 'tis (we ſay) the more becoming the Author thereof, and an Evidence of his Divine Stamp and Authority. Yet in that Humility of Stile in Scripture, there is far more Height and Loftineſs, and more Profoundneſs in its Simplicity, more Beauty in its Nakedneſs, and more Vigor and Acuteneſs in its (ſeeming) Rudeneſs, than in thoſe other Things Men ſo much praiſe and admire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eaſineſs and Plainneſs doth beſt become the Truth.

                     <hi>That the Scepter ſhould not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law-giver from between his Feet untill</hi> Shiloh <hi>come; and to him ſhall the gathering of the People be:</hi> was not compleatly fulfilled till well near two thouſand Years after, tho made good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a great part of that Time, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Entrance of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> upon the Government, in King <hi>David,</hi> until the going of it out again in the Perſon of <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifies. But when the Time appointed was expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Prophecy it ſelf was compleatly fulfilled: For when <hi>Herod,</hi> a Stranger, and of another Nation, had cut off the Houſe and Line of <hi>Judah</hi> from the Government of <hi>Jewry,</hi> then and at that Time <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the long-expected <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> our Lord Chriſt, punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally came into the World: for that by <hi>Shiloh</hi> is meant the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Jewiſh Rabbies do not deny. Now at the Time of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s uttering theſe Words, there was little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that any of his Poſterity ſhould have a Scepter, or any <hi>Kingly Power,</hi> being <hi>poor, few,</hi> and in a <hi>ſtrange Land:</hi> Or, if they ſhould thrive ſo, as to become a Kingdom, or Nation, why ſhould <hi>Judah</hi> have the Government, ſeeing there were three elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Reuben, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi?</hi> Nor was there likelihood of this Prophecy's being accompliſh'd, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet it down in Writing; for then he himſelf (who was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>) was in the actual Poſſeſſion of the Government, and put into it by God himſelf, who appointed for his Succeſſor, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> not of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> but of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Whence we have a notable Evidence of the Truth and Sincerity of this Prediction; for had not <hi>Jacob</hi> really uttered it, we cannot imagine <hi>Moſes</hi> would have put ſuch a Prophecy in Writing, to the diſparagement of his own Tribe. How accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately are the four great Monarchies of the World deſcribed by <hi>Daniel?</hi>
                     <note n="(f)" place="margin">Dan 7.3.</note> ſo lively, as if he had lived under them, and had that experience of them all reſpectively, which the World hath ſince had of them. How wonderful is that Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> at the end of his 44th, and the beginning of the 45th Chapter, touching <hi>Cyrus,</hi> delivered at leaſt an hundred Years (ſome ſay, two hundred) before he was born, wherein yet he is not only expreſly named, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord to his Anointed</hi> Cyrus; but it is foretold, he ſhould conquer <hi>Babylon,</hi> and rebuild the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> which came to paſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Nor can this Prophecy be ſuſpected of <hi>Forgery,</hi> or to be ſuppoſititious in any kind, ſince it was pronounced openly, as other Prophecies were, in the hearing of all the People, and ſo divulged into many hands, before the Captivity, and then alſo carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> where no doubt it was peruſed by many, long before the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it. And that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Cyrus</hi> many Years afterwards, that conquered <hi>Babylon,</hi> and reſtored the <hi>Jews</hi> from their Captivity, and furthered the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple, all Heathen Authors, that write of thoſe Times, do affirm. And indeed one great Inducement of his Kindneſs to the <hi>Jews,</hi> was, becauſe he underſtood how his Succeſſes had been thus propheſied of, ſo long before, by one of that Nation. So that it appears the ſaid Prophecy was then publickly known, and its Truth and Authentick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no way doubted of. How manifeſtly are the many Prophecies of the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning our Saviour, fulfilled? And how dreadfully his Prophecy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was made good about forty Years after his Crucifixion, we find in the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> exactly correſponding to what is foretold in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. And
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:39531:10"/> how many other Prophecies of the New-Teſtament, and eſpecially of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> do we daily find Verified in and by the Apoſtacy, and wicked Uſurpations of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Since therefore to foretell ſo plainly, Particulars and Events ſo remote, and depending on the meer Motions and Acts of the Wills of particular Perſons, yet unborn, is an evident Mark of Omniſciency; we cannot but conclude, that the Scriptures, which are fill'd with ſo many evident and certain Predictions, muſt certainly <hi>proceed from the Finger of God.</hi>

Many and great Wonders, ſuch as Satan himſelf cannot imitate, ſuch as exceed the Power of any, yea, of all the Creatures in the World; ſuch as the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Enemies could not deny to be divine, hath the Lord openly wrought by the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, for the Confirmation of this Truth.<note n="(g)" place="margin">Numb. 11.9. Exod. 19.16. 1 Kings 17.24. Mark 16.20. Acts 5.12.</note> Theſe Miracles are recorded and atteſted by Perſons of unqueſtionable Credit, that were Eye and Ear-Witneſſes. The Things done, as raiſing the Dead to Life, curing the Blind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were Matters of Fact, eaſy to be diſcerned. They were not done once or twice, but very often; not in the Night, or in a Corner, but in the open Light, in the midſt of the People, in the preſence of great Multitudes, who were generally Enemies to thoſe that wrought theſe Miracles: So that if the Relations of them were falſe, they would preſently have diſproved them; or if there had been any Deceit, they would ſoon have detected it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When God puts forth his Miracle-working Power,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
                        </note> in the Confirmation of any Word or Doctrine, he avows it to be of and from himſelf, to be abſolutely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true; ſetting the fulleſt and openeſt Seal unto it, which Men, who cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Eſſence or Being, are capable of receiving or diſcerning. And therefore when any Doctrine, which in it ſelf is ſuch as becometh the Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, is confirmed by the Emanation of his Divine Power in working of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, there can no greater Aſſurance, even by God himſelf, be given to confirm the Truth of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And as we have the Teſtimony of the Evangeliſts, to confirm the many Miracles that Jeſus did; we alſo plead the Notoriety of thoſe Miracles wrought by him, and the Traditions delivering them down to us: They were openly wrought, and were all or moſt of them perform'd before the Eyes of Multitudes, who envied, hated, and perſecuted him, and that in the moſt knowing Days of the World, when Reaſon and Learning had improved the Light of the Minds of Men to the utmoſt of their Capacity; in and upon Multitudes, for ſundry Years together, being all of them ſifted by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, to try if they could diſcover any thing of Deceit in them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, the very Enemies have not had the impudence to deny ſuch notorious Matters of Fact, as our Saviour's Miracles;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in his <hi>Antiquity of the Jews,</hi> makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mighty Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that Jeſus did. See <hi>p.</hi> 400.</note> only they aſcribe them to other Cauſes. Even to this Day, the Jews acknowledg much of the Works of Chriſt, but ſlanderouſly and blaſphemouſly father them on the Power of the Devil, or upon the Force of the Name of God ſowed up in his Thigh; and ſuch like ridiculous Stories they have. Even the <hi>Turks</hi> confeſs much of the Miracles of our Lord, and believe him to be a great Prophet, though they are profeſt Enemies to the Chriſtian Name. Nor could all the Adverſaries of theſe Miracles and Relations, with all their Arguments or Violence, hinder Thouſands from believing them, and even expoſing their Lives on that Belief, in the very Time and Country where they were done. So that we muſt ſay, Either they were <hi>Miracles,</hi> or <hi>not:</hi> If they were, why do you not believe? If they were not, behold the greateſt Miracle of all, that ſo many Thouſands (even of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders) ſhould be ſo blind, as to believe Things that never were, eſpecially in thoſe very Times, when it was the eaſieſt Matter in the World to have diſproved ſuch Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. Indeed the Miracles of Jeſus, and thoſe of his Diſciples and Servants, in the Primitive Times, were in Fact ſo many, ſo eminent, ſo viſible, and laſted ſo long, (for they continued in the Church two or three hundred Years) and the Account of them has deſcended down to us by ſuch a conſtant, uninterrupted <hi>written</hi> and <hi>unwritten</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that ſcarce any Man has aſſumed Impudence enough to gainſay them. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (who lived about the Year of our Lord 200) affirmeth, that in his Time the working of Miracles, the <hi>raiſing of the Dead,</hi> the <hi>caſting out of Devils, healing the Sick by meer laying on of Hands, and Propheſying, were ſtill in force; and that ſome that were ſo raiſed from the Dead, remained alive amongst them long after.</hi> And <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> mention the ordinary caſting out of Devils, and challenge the Heathen to come and ſee it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

                     <hi>Let any one be brought before your Tribunals, who is apparently poſſeſſed with a Devil, that Spirit, being commanded by any Chriſtian, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs of truth himſelf to be a Devil, as at other Times he boaſts himſelf a God.</hi> And in his Book to <hi>Scapula,</hi> the Procurator of <hi>Africk, Cap.</hi> 4. he repeats ſeveral miraculous Cures done by Chriſtians: <hi>Quanti honeſti viri,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How many Perſons of good Quality and Eſteem,</hi> ſays he, <hi>(for we ſpeak not of the Vulgar Sort) have been remedied either from Devils or Diſeaſes?</hi> Severus <hi>himſelf, the Father of</hi> Antoninus, <hi>was recovered by Chriſtians,</hi> &amp;c. So that here we have the <hi>beſt Doctrine</hi> under the <hi>higheſt Atteſtation,</hi> God himſelf ſetting thereunto his ſupernatural Seals, to convince us of the Truth thereof. And this was the great Argument, whereby Chriſt all along convinced the World; for upon his beginning of <hi>Miracles,</hi> at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> he manifeſted his Glory, and his Diſciples believed in him<note n="(i)" place="margin">Joh. 1.48.</note>. The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore enquired for <hi>Signs,</hi> as that which muſt confirm any new Revelation to be of God<note n="(k)" place="margin">Joh. 2.18.</note>. And tho Chriſt blames them for their unreaſonable unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Expectations herein, and would not humor them in each Particular; yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to give them Miracles as great as they deſired. They that ſaw the Miracles of the <hi>Loaves,</hi> ſaid, <hi>This is of a truth the Prophet that ſhould come into the World</hi>

To theſe aſtoniſhing Miracles we may fitly add, the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of theſe holy Writings for ſo many Ages, being it ſelf little leſs than <hi>miraculous,</hi> and ſuch as is a great Argument, that they belong to God, as the Author and Parent of them: It being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to derive that from God, as a Book of his own Dictates, about which he has exerciſed a <hi>peculiar Care.</hi> Were not the Bible what it pretends to be, there had been nothing more ſuitable to the Nature of God, and more becoming Divine Providence, than <hi>long ſince to have blotted it out of the World:</hi> For why ſhould he ſuffer a Book to continue from the beginning of Times, falſly pretending his Name and Authority? How do learned Men accuſe <hi>Time</hi> of Injuries, for ſwallowing up the Works of many excellent Authors! and bewail the Loſs of divers of <hi>Livy</hi>'s Decades, and other <hi>choice</hi> Books, which are now <hi>no where to be found!</hi> Nay, tho the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo careful for the preſervation of the Books of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> that they lock'd them up in Places of greateſt Safety, and appointed ſpecial <hi>Officers</hi> to look after them; yet many Ages ſince they are gone and periſhed, and only ſome few <hi>Fragments</hi> do now remain. Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Bible, notwithſtanding part of it was the <hi>firſt Book</hi> in the World, (as we proved in the ſecond Argument) and tho the Craft of Satan, and the Rage of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, have from time to time combin'd utterly to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> it; yet it has born up its Head, and remains not only extant, but <hi>whole and entire,</hi> without the leaſt Mutilation or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> when he ſet up the Abomination of Deſolation in the Jewiſh Temple, in the Days of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> with utmoſt diligence made <hi>ſearch after their Law,</hi> and whereſoever he found it, immediatly burnt or deſtroy'd it, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Death, with exquiſite Tortures, to any that ſhould <hi>conceal</hi> or <hi>retain</hi> it. In like manner, ſince Chriſt, the Tyrant <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> about the Year 300, with a full purpoſe to root out Chriſtianity for ever out of the World, publiſhes an Edict, That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould <hi>every where be burnt</hi> and deſtroyed; and whoſoever ſhould preſume to <hi>keep them,</hi> ſhould be moſt ſeverely tormented: Yet God permitted them not to quench the Light of theſe Divine Laws. But the Old Teſtament, above two hundred Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Incarnation of Chriſt, was tranſlated into <hi>Greek,</hi> (the moſt flouriſhing and ſpreading Language at that time in the World); and about thirty Years before Chriſt, it was paraphras'd into <hi>Caldee;</hi> and at this Day, both Old and New Teſtaments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, not only in their Original Languages, but in moſt other Tongues and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages that are ſpoken upon the Face of the Earth, which <hi>no other</hi> Book can pretend to. So that all Endeavours that have from the very firſt been bent againſt it, have been
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:39531:11"/> vanquiſhed; and remarkable Judgments and Vengeance ſhew'd on all ſuch as have been the moſt violent Oppoſers of it. And further, whereas even <hi>thoſe</hi> to whom it was outwardly committed, as the <hi>Jews</hi> firſt, and the Antichriſtian Church of Apoſtatiz'd <hi>Rome</hi> afterwards, not only fell into Opinions and Practices abſolutely inconſiltent with it, but alſo built all their preſent and future Intereſts on thoſe Opinions and Practices; yet none of them could ever <hi>obliterate</hi> one Line in it, not even of thoſe Places which make moſt againſt their obſtinate Errors and Defections: But for their own Plea, they both are forced to pretend <hi>additional Traditions,</hi> (for the <hi>Miſhua, Talmud,</hi> and <hi>Cabala</hi> of the Jews, and the <hi>Oral Traditions</hi> of the Papiſts, all proceed from one and the ſame Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> a wicked Pretence, that the Scriptures, tho divine Truths, and the Word of God, yet do not contain <hi>all</hi> God's Will; but that there are theſe other unwritten Verities handed down, one ſays from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other ſays; from St <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. by Word of Mouth.)</p>
                  <p>Since therefore the Bible hath thus wonderfully ſurmounted all Difficulties and Oppoſitions, for ſo many Generations, and in ſo many Dangers, and againſt ſo many Endeavours to root it out of the World, we may (according to that Maxim in Philoſophy, <hi>Eadem eſt Cauſa procreans &amp; conſervans;</hi> The procreating and conſerving Cauſe of Things, is one and the ſame) conclude, That the ſame God is the Author of it, who hath thus by his ſpecial Providence preſerved it, and faithfully promiſed (and cannot Lie) that <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but one Iota or Tittle of his Word ſhall not paſs away.</hi>

And remarkable it is, both, that notwithſtanding the High Prieſts and others of that Nation perſecuted the Prophets while they lived, yet received their Writings as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical</hi> and Divine; as alſo, that ſince the Spirit of Blindneſs and Obſtinacy is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and notwithſtanding their great hatred to the Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t them, even in thoſe places which do evidently confirm the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3. And as for the Chriſtian Church, it hath with great Conſtancy, and ſweet Conſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and acknowledged the Books of the Old and New Teſtament; for the Univerſal Church, which from the beginning thereof until theſe times profeſſed the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be Divine, did and doth alſo profeſs that theſe Books are of God: And the ſeveral Primitive Churches which firſt received the Books of the Old Teſtament, and the Goſpels, the Epiſtles written from the Apoſtles to them, their Paſtors, or ſome they knew, did receive them as the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> and delivered them afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Title to their Succeſſors and other Churches: And all the Paſtors and Doctors (who being furniſhed with Skill both in the Languages and Matters, have tryed and ſearched into them) and all pious Chriſtians, who by Experience have felt their Divine Operation, on their own Souls, have aſſerted the ſame. So that whoever rejects the <hi>Bible,</hi> obliges himſelf to believe <hi>no other Books</hi> in the World whatſoever; for ſince <hi>none</hi> of them have any ſuch great and univerſal Atteſtations, if he ſhall credit them, and not <hi>this,</hi> it will ſhew apparent diſingenuity and <hi>peeviſh Obſtinacy.</hi> And ſecondly, He that <hi>does credit</hi> the Author of this Book, with the ſame Credit wherewith he credits other Authors, whom he ſuppoſes Men of common Honeſty that would not knowingly write an Untruth, cannot then refuſe to receive this as a Book <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> upon as good Terms of Credibility, as he believes any the beſt Human Author in its kind to be <hi>True;</hi> becauſe they themſelves tell us that it is ſo, (which were it otherwiſe, without moſt apparent Falſhood they would not do); They affirming that God himſelf inſpired them to write it, and that it was no Product of their own, but every part of it the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Dictate of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>And this Argument is abundantly reinforc'd and ſtrengthned from the Conſideration of that Glorious Company of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> thoſe <hi>Innumerable Multitudes,</hi> who in the Flames and Rage of Perſecution, have with the loſs of their <hi>Lives</hi> maintained the Scriptures to be the Sacred Word of God, and had the ſame in ſuch Veneration, that in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ages the <hi>Traditors</hi> (Deliverers up of their Bibles to the Heathen to be deſtroyed) were always eſteemed as bad as profeſs'd <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> Since therefore they did ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with ſuch Hazards affirm this Truth, what ſhadow of Reaſon is there to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> of Folly, Weakneſs, Credulity, Wickedneſs, or Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy amongſt themſelves?

Nor can we ſuppoſe that <hi>Popular Eſteem</hi> on Earth, and <hi>Vain-Glory</hi> could be the Ground upon which they <hi>ſuffered,</hi> ſince they gave up their Lives for a Religion, which both ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>condemned</hi> ſuch <hi>Vanity,</hi> and was every where in the World at that time <hi>odious</hi> and deteſtable, and whoſe Profeſſion brought nothing but outward <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Contempt.</hi>

He that diſowns the Bible to be of Divine Authority, muſt either think there is ſome Revelation from God to the World, how he will be worſhipped, and how they ought to conduct themſelves; or he thinks there is none: If he thinks there is none, he not only gives the Lie to the Chriſtian and Jewiſh, but generally to all Religion, that has been, or is in the World: For they all have pretended, and do alledg the ſame as their Foundation. And beſides, he muſt confeſs, that God (who has made Man the nobleſt of Creatures, and Lord of the whole World) has left him in a worſe Condition, in the preſent Poſture we find him, than the meaneſt Creatures, to whom he has given ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Means to attain the higheſt End of their Beings: But that infinite Wiſdom ſhould deal thus, is abſurd and unreaſonable to conceive.

Nor were the Scriptures the Invention of Men; for they muſt be either good Men, or bad Men: Good Men they could not be; for nothing could be more oppoſite to Goodneſs, nay, even <hi>common Honeſty,</hi> than to aſſume the Name of God falſly, feign Miracles, and cheat People with Promiſes of another World. And then on the other ſide, 'tis as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ill Men could be the Deviſers of ſo holy a Book: For can any rational Man think, that wicked Deceivers would ſo highly advance the Glory of God? Would they ſo vilify themſelves, and brand and ſtigmatize their own Practices? Could ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable undeniable Spirit of Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Self-denial, as runs through every Vein of Scripture, proceed from the Invention of the Wicked? Would they ever have extolled their Enemies, the <hi>Godly,</hi> and framed ſuch perfect ſpiritual Laws? or laid ſuch a Deſign againſt the Fleſh, and all their worldly Happineſs, as every-where the Scope of the Scripture doth carry on?

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. How Men, in the reſpective Ages wherein the ſeveral parts of the Bible were written, could know that they were written by an infallible Spirit, and ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from other Writings?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two ways: Firſt, by the Quality of the Perſons; and ſecondly, from the Nature and Quality of the Matter. As for <hi>Moſes,</hi> there could not be the leaſt Cauſe of doubting his being inſpired by God, ſince he wrought ſuch Miracles, and had a viſible and audible Entercourſe with the Lord, as we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.9. that the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Lo, I come unto thee in a thick Cloud, that the People may hear when I ſpeak with thee, and believe thee for ever.</hi> The other Parts of the Old Teſtament were written by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and holy Men. And tho ſeveral of them were not received and hearkned to as ſuch, by the corrupt ruling Part of the Jews, whilſt they lived; yet they were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged afterwards, as well for the Sanctity of their Lives, and the fulfilling of thoſe things mentioned, the Judgments which they foretold coming to paſs, and the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of what they delivered to the eſtabliſh'd Worſhip of God. For two ways God himſelf had provided, for diſcovering all Pretences to Revelation: Firſt, If any ſuch Pretender went about to ſeduce the People to Idolatry, he was to be rejected. — <hi>The Prophet that ſhall ſpeak in the Name of other Gods, ſhall die</hi>
                     <note n="(f)" place="margin">Deut. 19.20.</note>. Secondly; If the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came not to paſs, as we have it in the next Verſe ſave one; <hi>When a Prophet ſpeaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the Thing follow not, nor come to paſs, that is the Thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken, but the Prophet hath ſpoken it preſumptuouſly.</hi> And a final Deciſion, what was to be received for the Old Teſtament, God was pleaſed to make, after the Babyloniſh Captivity, in the Days of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and that famous Synagogue, ſeveral of the laſt Prophets being perſonally preſent, where, by a divine Direction, all the Parts of the Old Teſtament were collected, and a Separation made, not only between the Works of true Prophets and falſe; and ſuch Writings as came by divine Inſpiration, from thoſe that were of divine Extraction; and ſuch as were to be a perpetual Rule to the Church, from ſuch as relating only to particular Caſes, were not ſo.

                     <q>In a word, let it be granted, that all who are really converted unto God, by the Power of the Word, have that infallible Evidence and Teſtimony of its divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Authority and Power in their own Souls and Conſciences, that they thereon believe it with Faith divine and ſupernatural, in conjunction with the other Evidences before-mentioned, (and largely demonſtrated) as parts of the ſame divine Teſtimony; and it is all I aim at herein.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Teſtimony, tho it is not common unto all, nor can it convince another, yet is it very forceable to thoſe who experience the Virtue and Efficacy thereof, which we, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in another place more largely opened, we ſhall conclude this laſt Argument, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all to labour after a taſte of its divine, powerful, and Soul-changing Operations, and then they will need no further Arguments to prove 'tis of God.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall therefore conclude this brief Diſcourſe on this Subject, with thoſe excellent Words of a Learned Man upon the ſome occaſion: — <q>Let this remain and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as an eſtabliſh'd Truth, That thoſe whom the Spirit hath inwardly taught, do ſolidly acquieſce in the Scripture; And that the ſame is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Self-credible, or for its own ſake worthy of belief, and that it obtains that Certainty which it juſtly deſerves with us, by the Teſtimony of the Spirit: For tho its own Majeſty does of itſelf conciliate a Reverence, yet then only does it ſeriouſly affect us, when by the Spirit it is ſealed in &amp; upon our hearts. With whoſe Truth being enlightned, we no longer believe that the Scripture is from God by our own Judgment, or that of other Men, but moſt certainly above all humane Judgment, we are aſſured thereof no otherwiſe, than as if there we beheld the very Voice of God, by the Miniſtry of Men, flowing from the Mouth of God to us. No longer do we then ſeek for Arguments, and probable Proofs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Judgment may rely, but ſubject our Judgment and Underſtanding thereunto, as to a Matter already out of all doubt or debate; yet not ſo, as wretched Men are wont to addict their captive Minds to Superſtitions, but becauſe we find and feel the undoubted Power of God there to breath and flouriſh; To obey which, we are drawn and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, knowingly and willingly, but more livelily and efficaciouſly, than either humane Will or Knowledg could affect us. 'Tis therefore <hi>ſuch a Perſuaſion</hi> as does not require Reaſons, (and yet it does not want them neither); <hi>ſuch a Knowledg,</hi> to which the beſt Reaſon appears and agrees, as being ſuch as therein the Mind can acquieſce more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſtantly, than in any Reaſons. 'Tis, <hi>in fine,</hi> ſuch a Senſe, ſuch a Taſte, as can proceed from nothing, but a Revelation Divine. Nor do I ſpeak any thing but what every true Believer can bear witneſs to from his own Experience, ſave only that Words are too ſhort and unable to expreſs a juſt Explication of the thing.—<hi>Calv.

                              <p>IX. Sincerity is a glorious Ornament. A Chriſtian hereby appears very comely in the ſight of God, and it greatly tends to hide and cover all the Infirmities of his Life; for the Saints Graces are not ſo cloſe, nor their Lives ſo exact, but in the beſt are found Defects and Weakneſſes, which are as ſo many Gaps or Clifts in his Armor; but Sincerity covers all, ſo that he is not put to ſhame by them.</p>
                              <p>1. Sincerity covers all outward Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, or want of outward Beauty, that great Idol of the World. Sincere Perſons, if they be not ſo fair and comely as ſome others, yet being holy and upright, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and vertuous Ones, how amiable are they rendred hereby in the ſight of all good Men! It covers all things that ſeems to render a Saint diſhonourable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely.</p>
                              <p>2. Mean Parentage, or a low Deſcent, is much deſpiſed in the World; but how baſe ſoever the Stock, and ignoble the Birth be, when true Grace and Sincerity comes, it makes the Houſe and Perſon illuſtrious, and very glorious: <hi>Since thou wert precious in mine eyes, thou haſt been honourable,</hi> Iſa. 43.4. Sincerity ſets a Mark of Honour upon a Perſon, or a People. If you ſee this flouriſhing, tho in a mean Cottage, it tells you a great Prince, nay, an Heir of Heaven dwells there. Sincerity brings the Creature into Alliance with the moſt high and glorious King of Heaven and Earth. Who dares ſay, a Child of God, the Spouſe of Chriſt, and Heir of Heaven is of an ignoble Birth and Pedigree?</p>
                              <p>3. It covers Poverty, which expoſeth to great Contempt. There's none ſo rich as a godly ſincere Perſon; he is daily let into God's Treaſury, Chriſt's Storehouſe is always open unto him: <hi>All is yours.</hi>

                              <p>4. To want Parts, and to be a Perſon of no Name, and of ſmall Endowments, expoſeth to diſdain; none are more contemptible in the eye of the wiſe and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious World, than ſuch. But alas! an honeſt Heart, one that is ſincere, excells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all compariſon the proudeſt, moſt renowned and applauded for human Wiſdom, Parts, and Elegancy in the World.</p>
                              <p>5. It covers all ſinful Uncomelineſs, and all the Godly Man's Failings, whether they be Sins of Omiſſion or Commiſſion; for Sincerity is that excellent quality to which pardoning Mercy is annexed. 'Tis Chriſt in a proper ſence that covers all Sin, but he will cover the Sins and Failings of none but ſuch as are ſincere:<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.2.</note> 
                                 <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whoſe Sins are covered,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p n="1">1. Take heed of a counterfeit Girdle; ſee that what you own and practiſe for Truth have the Stamp of God upon it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Take up nothing upon Truſt: Do not receive this or that, becauſe ſuch and ſuch Men believe ſo, and practiſe ſo; neither Men nor Miniſters are your Rule, but the Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Put not this Girdle of Truth on in Notion only; what will the knowledg of Truth ſignify in thy Head, if the Loins of thy Mind are not girt with it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Take heed of being prejudiced againſt the Truth, becauſe of the Unworthineſs of them who profeſs it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If thou haſt not yet gotten the Girdle of Truth, buy it now;<note place="margin">Prov. 23.23.</note> as <hi>Solomon</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>Buy the Truth, and ſell it not.</hi> The Price of Truth may quickly riſe high.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Let Falſhood go, let thy Sins go, let thy own Righteouſneſs go, in point of reliance or dependence upon it, ſo as to truſt in it for Juſtification and eternal Life.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Come up to the Price of Truth; do not cheapen it only, but come up to the Price, tho it coſt thee a right Hand Luſt of Profit; or a right Eye Luſt of Pleaſure: Thou muſt deny thy ſelf.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. Conſider what God's People have ſuffered before they would part with Truth, what Torments and Tortures they have endured.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. He is not a perfect and ſincere Chriſtian, whoſe Heart is not changed, who is not renewed, or who hath not a Principle of Divine Grace or ſpiritual Life in him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He is not a perfect and ſincere Perſon, that wants any eſſential part of a Chriſtian; as he is not a perfect natural Child, that wants an Arm, an Eye, or a Leg. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. <hi>One thing thou lackeſt, if thou wouldeſt be perfect,</hi> (or approve thy ſelf ſincere) <hi>go thy way, and ſell what thou haſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He is not a ſincere Perſon, whoſe Heart is lifted up in him.<note place="margin">Hab. 2.4.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. He is not a ſincere Man, that is not upright in all his Dealings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Men; if he want Moral Uprightneſs, his Religion is good for nothing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; <hi>In the Affirmative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. A ſincere and upright Chriſtian is known by the Way he goes in:<note place="margin">Prov. 16.17. Job 1:2:</note> 
                        <hi>The High-way of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright is to depart from Evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) He eſcheweth all Evil, the ſmalleſt, as well as the greateſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) He leaveth it willingly, he hates it; he doth not part with it as a Man parteth with his Friend, but as a Man parteth with his moſt deadly and mortal Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſincere Perſon hath a right Faith, and a good and well-enlightned Judgment. Rotten Principles make rotten Chriſtians.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.8</note> There are ſome Men who are of <hi>corrupt Minds, reprobate,</hi> (or of no Judgment) <hi>concerning the Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. He hath an holy and upright End, he deſires to live to God's Glory, and to ſerve him in Sincerity. <hi>Paul</hi> reſolved, <hi>Chriſt ſhould be magnified in his Body, whether it were by Life, or by Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. He walks by a true and an exact Rule: <hi>As many as walk according to this Rule,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Peace on them, and Mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. He labours to keep all God's Commandments. Thus did <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.9. Luk. 1.6.</note> who was a <hi>Man after God's own Heart;</hi> and thus did <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who <hi>walked in all the Commandments of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He deſires to be ſanctified, as well as to be ſaved; to be made holy, as well as to be made happy.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He is as willing to do for God, as to receive from God; for the Work, as well as the Wages.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. He ſtrives as much againſt the Evils of his Heart, as he does againſt the Evils of his Life.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. He is a Man always for God, in bad Times as well as in good Times.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. He is the ſame in private as in publick; he is at home what he ſeems to be abroad.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He loves and prefers God and Chriſt above all. Thus <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73.25. and <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. He can go on in God's Ways and Services with abundance of content, without reſpect to any outward Profit or Applauſe, or being taken notice of by Men. His Satisfaction conſiſteth not in the approbation of Men, but in the approbation and commendation of God. His own Conſcience gives Teſtimony and Evidence of the Sincerity of his Heatt. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing,</hi>

                        <item>Evangelical</item>
                     </list> Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now a Moral or Legal Righteouſneſs will not ſave or defend the Saint, or ſpiritual Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt, from his Enemy:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.20</note> 
                     <hi>Except your Righteouſneſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye can in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Paul</hi> valued not his own Righteouſneſs that was of the Law. All our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that which flows not from Faith, or from a renewed Principle of the Spirit, is but as filthy Rags. Therefore that cannot be the Righteouſneſs here intended.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Evangelical Righteouſneſs is twofold:
<list>
                        <item>1. Imputed.</item>
                        <item>2. Imparted.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt; The Righteouſneſs imputed is that which was wrought by Chriſt for the Believer in the days of his Fleſh, by his active and paſſive Obedience to the Law of God, which is put upon the Soul by Faith, called the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God by Faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil 3.9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; The Righteouſneſs imparted is that which is wrought by Chriſt in the Soul; it is a ſupernatural Work, or a new Life planted in the Heart of every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by the powerful Operations of the Holy-Ghoſt, whereby he is made holy, and enabled to approve himſelf to God and Men, in all purity of Life and Converſation.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Breaſtplate of Righteouſneſs</hi> in the Text, we underſtand the Righteouſneſs of Sanctification is principall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> intended; for otherwiſe this piece of Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor would interfere with the Shield of Faith, which comprehends the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Juſtification. <hi>[See Shield.]</hi> It is (we ſay) a Principle of new Life, which the Spirit works in the Heart of a Believer; hence the ſeveral Graces of Holineſs are called the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22. Man by the Fall had a double Loſs; firſt, the Love of God; ſecondly, the Image or Likeneſs of God: Chriſt reſtores both to his Children; the firſt, by his Righteouſneſs imputed; the ſecond, by his Spirit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting the loſt Image of God to them, which conſiſts in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. Who but a Man can impart his own Nature, and beget a Child like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? So who but the Spirit of God can make a Creature like God, by cauſing him to partake of the Divine Nature?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is that Principle of new Life, <hi>viz.</hi> an inward Diſpoſition, and Divine Quality, ſweetly, powerfully, and conſtantly ſtirring up and inclining to that which is holy, and ſpiritually good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Work of the Spirit in this reſpect was not to recover what was dying,<note place="margin">Garnal.</note> but to work Life <hi>de novo</hi> in a Soul quite dead; hence called a creating, quickning, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and renewing Work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a ſupernatural Principle, by which we diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which was co-natural to him, as Sin is to us. Holineſs was as natural to him, as Health was to his Body; they both reſulted <hi>ex Principiis rectè conſtitutis,</hi> from Principles pure and rightly diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>Why Righteouſneſs is called a Breaſt-plate, will appear by the following Parallel.</p>

                           <cell>RIghteouſneſs in like manner is a principal thing belonging to all Chriſtians, who are called Souldiers of Chriſt:<note place="margin">2 Tim 3 3.</note>

                           <cell>II. Righteouſneſs is ſo neceſſary for every Believer, that he ought not, cannot be without it; there is no engaging any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39531:20"/> Enemy of the Soul, without a Principle of Holineſs be wrought in him.</cell>

                           <cell>III. A Breaſt-plate preſerves the principal part of the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> the Breaſt, where the very Vitals of a Man are cloſely couched together, and where a Shot or a Stab is more deadly, than in other parts, that are more remote from the Fountain of Life. A Man may out-live ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wounds received in the Arms or Legs, but a Stab in the Heart is a certain Meſſenger of Death.</cell>
                           <cell>III. Righteouſneſs and Holineſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the principal part of a Chriſtian, <hi>viz.</hi> his Soul. Satan aims to hit him there where he may diſpatch him ſooneſt. A Wound in a Man's Credit, Eſtate, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hazard not the Life of his Soul; but Sin expoſes it to imminent Danger. This is that Dart,<note place="margin">Prov. 7 23</note> that <hi>ſtruck the young Man through the Liver, as a Bird haſteth to the Snare, that knoweth not 'tis for his Life.</hi> And this is that which Satan ſtrives to tempt, entice, and draw a Saint to yield unto. Hence he ſhould be careful to put on his Breaſtplate of Righteouſneſs, which whilſt he has on, he is ſafe from the deadly Stab of the Enemy.</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                           <cell>IV. A Breaſt-plate is made and prepared for a Souldier, before he puts it on. It is not his own Work, but the Work of a skilful Artiſt.</cell>
                           <cell>IV. Righteouſneſs, which is the Saints Breaſt-plate, is wrought in him by the Holy Spirit, who is a moſt wiſe and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Workman. Our own Righteouſneſs is good for nothing, hence called <hi>dead Works,</hi> becauſe they are Works from one dead in Sin, and ſpring not from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of inward ſpiritual Life.</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                           <cell>V. A Breaſt-plate much embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens a Souldier, and makes him fearleſs, that as he cannot be eaſily killed, ſo hereby he cannot be ſoon cowed. When a Souldier ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel unarmed, he begins to tremble; but when he hath on a good Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and a Plate of Proof on his Breaſt, he is not quickly diſmay'd, but adventures upon the Point of the Sword.</cell>
                           <cell>V. Thus Righteouſneſs defends and animates the Soul and Conſcience, when a Man in the midſt of the greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can lift up his hands without ſpot. Holineſs fills a Soul with Courage, ſo that he can look in the very face of grim Death; whereas Guilt, which is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of the Soul, puts the ſtouteſt Sinner into a ſhaking Fit of Fear. <hi>The Wicked flee, when no Man purſueth;</hi>

                           <cell>VI. So Righteouſneſs and Truth muſt meet, and be joined together in every Chriſtian; which is held forth by the Copulative <hi>[And] Stand therefore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Which is taken twofold, as hath been ſhewed: Firſt, for the Truth of Doctrine, or a good and Orthodox Judgment; all the Principles of true Religion, that are eſſential to Salvation. Secondly, Grace, or Sincerity of Heart. In both theſe reſpects, Truth muſt be claſped to, or joined with Righteouſneſs, and a holy Life. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Two are better than one:</hi> So may I ſay here, a good Doctrine with a good Converſation, is better than a good Doctrine without a good Converſation, or a good Converſation without a good Doctrine; as a Man muſt have the one, ſo he muſt not be without the other; Wo to him that is alone, for the Spirit will not be his Strength. An evil and corrupt Doctrine may be of as dangerous a Nature as an evil and debauched Life. See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Who privily bring in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift Deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. In vain is a Man's outward Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or moral Sincerity, if he be tainted with heretical and damnable Principles; and as vain is it for a Man to hold the true Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion, if he be not ſincere, and live a holy Life.</cell>

                        <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is the Deſign of God in all his Ordinances. The Word of God is both Seed to beget, and Food to nouriſh Holineſs begotten in the Heart. Every part of it contributes to this Deſign abundantly. The Preceptive part affords a perfect Rule of Holineſs; the Promiſes preſent us with admirable Encouragements, to entice and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure us thereunto; the Threatnings, or minatory part of the Word, are to deter and keep back from that which is contrary to it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is the Deſign of God in all his Providences, to make his People more holy. The Afflictions he brings upon them, are to refine and purify them: <hi>This is the Fruit of all, the taking away of your Sin.</hi> See <hi>Refiner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Saints are called God's Witneſſes; they ſhould from hence endeavour to ſhine forth in their Teſtimony for him. What he ſpeaks in his Word, touching his Juſtice, Holineſs, and utter Hatred of Sin and Ungodlineſs, they ought not only with their Lips, but alſo with their Lives, bear witneſs unto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> In regard of Satan, whoſe great Deſign is againſt the Holineſs of the Saints. How doth it behove them to walk with all Circumſpection, ſince they are continually beſieged and aſſaulted by ſo ſtrong an Enemy? As God's great Deſign is to further and prompt to Holineſs; ſo Satan's great Deſign is to hinder and obſtruct it: And what ſhould be our chief care to defend, but that which our Adverſaries Thoughts and Plots are moſt laid to aſſault and ſtorm?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Saints ſhould labour to have this Breaſt-plate on, <hi>viz.</hi> be holy, in regard of the World: <hi>Ye are the Light of the World.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5.13, 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Let your good Works ſo ſhine before Men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If theſe Lights become Darkneſs, or are darkned, no marvel if Men ſtumble: <hi>Wo unto the World becauſe of Offences; but rather wo to him by whom the Offence cometh. Ye are the Salt of the Earth:</hi> But if this Salt hath loſt its Savour, 'tis no wonder if the World ſtink and be unſavoury.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wicked Men (ſaith a worthy Miniſter) know not the Principle by which you walk, they cannot poſſibly diſcern the Excellency of that Way and Religion which you profeſs; but they can diſcern and make ſome Judgment of your Converſations; nay, and their Eyes are upon you, they watch to ſee your Failings. Spots are ſoon eſpied in your Coats; for tho they love not Holineſs themſelves, yet they expect that thoſe that profeſs themſelves to be Saints ſhould be holy. How ſhould this teach you to get on this Breaſt-plate?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This may greatly work upon the Ungodly, with whom you live and daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; nay, thoſe that will not be won by the Word, poſſibly may, and many times have been won and converted this way.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.1, 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This will however convince them, that you are the Servants of God, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-born Souls; it will ſilence them, and ſtop their Mouths:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.16.</note> 
                        <hi>That whereas they ſpeak evil of you, they may be aſhamed that falſely accuſe your good Converſation in Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. This will leave the World without excuſe in the Great Day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly;</hi> You ſhould labour after Holineſs, in regard of the Goſpel it ſelf which you profeſs. That will this way gain much Credit in the World. Nothing brings Religion into greater Contempt, or cauſeth it to be more ſlighted by the Ungodly, than the looſe, carnal, and unholy Lives of thoſe who profeſs it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly;</hi> You ought to labour after a godly Life, in regard of the ſincere and holy Miniſters of the Goſpel, and other faithful Saints and Souldiers of Chriſt. What can comfort and delight their Souls more than the holy, humble, and fruitful Lives of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> The Saints, thoſe excellent Ones, were all <hi>David</hi>'s Delight; and <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted them his Joy and Crown.

This made <hi>David</hi> weep,<note place="margin">Jer. 9 1.</note> yea, Rivers of Water to run down his Eyes; and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to <hi>wiſh his Head were Water, and his Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that he might weep day and night.

                        <hi>of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, They are Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt; whoſe End is Deſtruction, whoſe God is their Belly, whoſe Glory is in their Shame, who mind earthly things.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly;</hi> Chriſtians, in regard of themſelves, ought to labour after Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs; for this only will be the beſt Evidence to them of the Truth of Grace received, and of their Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. What will all other Attainments and Privileges ſignify, if they are not holy?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By this means they will be able to hold up their Heads in the Day of Trial: <hi>For our rejoycing is this,</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Theſe ſhall have Peace in Chriſt, tho they have Trouble in the World; Peace whilſt they live,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.37</note> and Peace when they die: <hi>Mark the perfect Man, and behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright; the End of that Man is Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe need not fear the Aſſaults of Satan, they have Armor of Proof on, a Breaſt-plate,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> that will preſerve their Souls from Death: <hi>There is therefore now no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly;</hi> Chriſtians ſhould labour to have on this Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, in regard of the Excellency of it. It is that which God himſelf is cloathed with; it is that which makes Angels to ſhine gloriouſly in Heaven. A Man is hereby capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to have Communion with God:<note place="margin">Pſal. 94 20</note> 
                        <hi>Shall the Throne of Iniquity have fellowſhip with thee?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> and laſtly; In regard of the Neceſſity of it: <hi>For without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhould we put on the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In Heart; we muſt be inwardly holy, Holineſs muſt begin there. <hi>Firſt make the Tree good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In Life. Negative Holineſs doth not only conſiſt in the leaving all groſs Sins, but in abſtaining from all appearance of Evil, and to leave and abſtain from it from right Principles; and not only to leave it, but to loath it.</p>
                     <p>Again, it conſiſteth in keeping up all holy and religious Duties, <hi>viz.</hi> Reading, Hearing, Praying, Diſtributing to the Poor, Conforming to all moral and poſitive Precepts; to be holy at home, in the Family, in the Church, in the World, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a good Conſcience towards God,<note place="margin">Acts 24.16.</note> and towards Men. This is to put on the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>I might give many Directions about putting it on, and alſo ſhew ſome of Satan's cunning Stratagems, in endeavouring to make uſeleſs this bleſſed Piece of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Armor, in laying Diſcouragements in the way of true Piety; or by perſuading Perſons they have this Breaſt-plate on, when 'tis a counterfeit one.

                              <p>III. So the Grace of Faith defends the whole Man, every part of a Chriſtian. 1. Sometimes Satan's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>emptations are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd againſt his Head, and if he can hit him there, he wounds ſorely. He will be diſputing againſt this Truth, and that Truth, and make a Chriſtian doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, if poſſible, becauſe his own Reaſon cannot comprehend them: As perhaps it may be about the Deity of Chriſt, or the Holy Trinity, how they can be three, and yet but one; or about Satisfaction, How the Debt is paid, and yet the Sinner freely pardoned? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Faith is as a Shield to a Saint at this time, and interpoſeth between a Chriſtian, and this Arrow of Satan; it comes in to the relief of the Saints weak Underſtanding, as ſeaſonable as <hi>Zerviah</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> when the Giant <hi>Iſhbibenob</hi> thought to have ſlain him. I'le truſt the Word of God, ſaith the Soul, rather than my own purblind Reaſon: what I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, I will believe. <hi>Thus</hi> Abraham, <hi>not being weak in Faith,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Rom. 4.19</note> 
                                 <hi>conſidered not his own Body now dead,</hi> &amp;c. Senſe and Reaſon would have made ſad work at ſuch a dead Lift, but Faith brought him off victoriouſly.</p>
                              <p>Secondly; Sometimes Satan ſtrives to hit the Conſcience, all his Aſſaults and fiery Darts are at another ſeaſon aimed at that, to wound that, to cauſe Horror and Terror within, by ſetting the Evil of Sin, and of his own Heart, and the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Life, before him. Satan ſets our Sins before us, not to humble us, but to wound us; he ſhews our Sins to us, but hides a Saviour from us. Satan hath ſometimes tempted gracious Perſons to lay violent hands upon themſelves, when the heinous Nature of their Sin hath appeared to them, and the Danger they are in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; as it was with the poor Jailor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> But now Faith prevents and keeps off all the Danger, and quencheth this fiery Dart. Chriſt died for Sinners, for the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of Sinners; and tho thou art a Sinner, a great Sinner, the worſt of Sinners, yet ſaith Faith, Thou art but a Sinner, and there is Mercy for ſuch. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> if thou canſt believe, and throw thy ſelf on Chriſt, thy Sins ſhall not be thy Ruin.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly; He labours to enſnare the Affections of the Soul, or deaden its fervent Love to Jeſus Chriſt, by preſenting the Pleaſures and Profits of this World to it.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39531:22"/> Thus he ſerved our Saviour himſelf. But now Faith ſhields off this Dart alſo, by ſhewing the Excellency of the Lord Jeſus to the Soul; and that all things without him, and in compariſon of him, are nothing, nay, leſs than nothing; and alſo by ſetting the World to come, and the Glory thereof, before the Eyes of the Soul.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> 
                                 <hi>Faith is the Subſtance of things hoped for, and the Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi>

                           <cell>IV. A Shield, tho heavy, and ſomewhat unwieldy, to ſuch as have not skill and ſtrength to uſe it; yet it is a moveable Piece of Armor, which an expert Souldier, with a watchful eye, can turn this way, and that way, to ſtop a Dart or Blow from lighting on any part that they were directed to by the Enemy.</cell>
                           <cell>IV. Faith is a piece of Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which unskilful Profeſſors are not ready to uſe, but an experienced Soul can turn it any way to keep off the Arrow and fiery Darts of Satan from hurting or wounding him. He obſerves what part the Enemy aims to hit, or how the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is laid. It is a great point of Chriſtian Wiſdom rightly to exerciſe the Shield of Faith; A Man muſt be ſure to have a watchful Eye upon his Adverſary, or elſe for all his Shield he may ſoon be wounded.</cell>

                           <cell>V. A Shield doth not only defend the whole Body, but it is a Defence to other parts of a Souldier's Armor alſo; it keeps off the Dart from the Helmet and Breaſt-plate likewiſe.</cell>
                           <cell>V. Faith doth not only defend the whole Soul, but alſo 'tis a Safeguard to all the other parts of a Chriſtian's Armor; it is that which ſecures Hope, the Helmet of Salvation, for without Faith Hope would ſoon be broken in pieces. Alſo it ſecures the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs; for neither Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, nor any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Holineſs in the Soul, will avail any thing without Faith.</cell>

                           <cell>VI. A Shield hath been of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful advantage to Souldiers in former Times, when it was in uſe; it hath preſerved them in the time of Battel from Death, and many mortal Wounds. Hence God is pleaſed to call Himſelf a <hi>Shield,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thereby his ſure and ſafe Protection to his People in Time of Trouble and Temptation. <hi>Fear not,</hi> Abraham, <hi>I am thy Shield.</hi>

                           <cell>VI. Faith hath been of wonderful uſe to the Saints of God in all Ages; it is that which hath preſerved them when hard beſet, in the greateſt Danger imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: <hi>I had fainted unleſs I had believed.</hi>

                              <p>V. True Faith is a moſt precious Grace in reſpect of its own intrinſecal Vertue, and from hence all true Chriſtians eſteem ſo highly of it. The Price thereof is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Rubies, it is far more precious than Gold that periſheth; which will appear by the Induction of the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                              <p>1. In reſpect of the Names or Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations given to it in holy Scripture. (1.) It is called Lively Faith. (2.) It is called Effectual Faith, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. (3.) It is called the Faith of God's Elect, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. (4.) It is called unfeigned Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. (5.) It is called Faith that works by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. (6.) It is called Faith of the Operation of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. (7.) It is called preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. (8.) It is called holy Faith. (9.) It is called the Faith of the Son of God. Its excellent Names ſet forth its tranſcendent Nature.</p>
                              <p>2. Faith is precious in reſpect of the Means of its procurement, or the Price that was laid down for the obtaining of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the precious Blood of Chriſt; for had not Chriſt died, we ſhould never have had one dram of it; it is given to us as the Fruit and Effect of his glorious Undertaking.</p>
                              <p>3. Faith is precious in reſpect of the Fountain from whence it proceeds.</p>
                              <p>4. Faith is precious in reſpect of the Means by which it is wrought in the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Word and Spirit of God in a wonderful manner,<note place="margin">Eph: 1.19, 20.</note> even like as God wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the Dead.</p>
                              <p>5. Faith is precious in reſpect of the Object it takes hold of, or faſteneth upon, <hi>viz.</hi> God the Father, the Holy Spirit, but more immediatly Chriſt crucified. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>6. Faith is precious in that it joins or unites the Soul to Chriſt, it makes us one with him, (as it were) Fleſh of his Fleſh, Bone of his Bone, a lively Member of that Body whereof he is the Head. 'Tis that which ties the Conjugal Knot between him and every Believer.</p>
                              <p>7. It is the Eye of rhe Soul; no Man without it can behold Jeſus Chriſt, nor the fulfillings of future Promiſes. <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith ſaw the Day of Chriſt.</p>
                              <p>8. Hereby a Chriſtian is made a Child of God. <hi>To as many as received him,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Joh. 1.12. Gal. 3.26.</note> 
                                 <hi>to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believed on his Name. Ye are all the Children of God, by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>9. It is the only way or means God is pleaſed to take, to deliver the Souls of Men from Sin, Wrath, and eternal Death.</p>
                              <p>10. It is that which intereſts the Soul into all the ſweet and precious Promiſes of the Covenant of Grace. <hi>See Light.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>11. It is the Inſtrument of Salvation. <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>12. Faith is a moſt excellent and precious thing, upon the account of the Fruits of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Life, Light, Peace, Purging, Boldneſs at the Throne of Grace, Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, Hope, and good Aſſurance of eternal Life.</p>
                              <pb n="17" facs="tcp:39531:23"/>
                              <p>13. Faith is precious in reſpect of that glorious Power and Virtue that is in it. 'Tis medicinable, and the moſt Sovereign Antidote and Cordial in the World. (1.) It will expell Poyſon. (2.) 'Twill perfectly (as it applies the Blood of Chriſt) cure a wounded Conſcience. (3.) It will bear up and revive a fainting Spirit;<note place="margin">Mat. 8.23.</note> 
                                 <hi>I had fainted unleſs I had believed.</hi> (4.) It is good againſt the Feebleneſs of the Knees, and Weakneſs of the hands. (5.) It is a moſt excellent thing againſt Fear, and Tremblings of the Heart. <hi>But when he ſaw the Wind boyſterous, he was afraid; and beginning to ſink,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Luk. 8.23. Mat. 14.30</note> 
                                 <hi>he cried, ſaying, Lord, ſave me. And immediatly Jeſus ſtretched forth his hand, and caught him, and ſaid unto him, O thou of little Faith!</hi> (6.<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.26.</note>) It is a precious Remedy againſt the Stone of a hard Heart; it will diſſolve it, break it in pieces, and cure the Soul perfectly of it. (7.) It cures all manner of inward Deadneſs, it may well be called <hi>lively Faith,</hi> or <hi>Faith of the Operation of God.</hi> (8.<note place="margin">Col. 2.12.</note>) It is good againſt the Dimneſs of the Eyes, it helps them that cannot ſee afar off. (9.) It is a moſt Sovereign Thing againſt evil Spirits; it will reſiſt the Devil, and make him flie. (10.) It is excellent good to purge and work out all thoſe noxious and evil Humors of the inward Man, cleanſing and purifying the Heart. 11. It is good againſt the Falling-Sickneſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſtand by Faith, but if through a Temptation they ſhould fall, Faith will help them up again. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had not ſo much Faith as to keep them from from falling, yet they had enough to raiſe them up again when they were fallen. It is an univerſal Remedy, it cures all the Diſeaſes of the Soul; ſo that we may ſay with the Woman, (let the Diſtemper be what it will) <hi>If I can but touch the Hem of his Garment, I ſhall be healed.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>14. Faith is precious, becauſe it ſhields and gloriouſly preſerves the whole Soul from all Dangers; it is that which works with, and tends to the perfecting of all other Graces in us.</p>
                              <p>15. It was by Faith that Saints, in every Age of the Church,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> were enabled to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo and ſuffer all thoſe hard and bitter Tortures and Torments they met with for Chriſt's ſake.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt, <hi>Information.</hi> How greatly are ſome miſtaken about this precious and moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grace? For we may infer from hence,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That true Faith is not a ſimple or bare believing there is a God; the Devils have this kind of Faith; they alſo believe, and tremble.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it is not a meer or bare believing the Truth of the holy Scriptures. The Jews believed the Scriptures, and thought by them to have eternal Life, and yet were Enemies to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it is not a bare believing Chriſt died for Sinners; moſt ungodly People in <hi>England</hi> believe that.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That cannot be a true Faith, which Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremongers, and all other ungodly and prophane Perſons have.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That a Man may leave all groſs Sins, and aſſent to many Truths of the Goſpel, and yet have no true Faith.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Nay, that a Man may be baptized, take upon him the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, and ſuffer many things, and yet not have one dram of ſaving Faith; as appears by the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, and many others.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Nay, a Man may ſeem to hear the Word with Joy, and yet have no true Faith. A temporary Faith is not the Faith of God's Elect, or that Faith that is more precious than Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How may a Man know true Faith from that which is common, and meer counterfeit?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is in that Perſon, who ſavingly believes in Chriſt, a true Knowledg of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, the true Saviour; it takes hold on the right Object. <hi>Doſt thou believe on the Son of God?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 9.24. &amp; 9.35. Rom. 10.14.</note> 
                        <hi>Who is he, Lord?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There muſt be a true Knowledg of, and a free and full Aſſent and Conſent to the Truth of that which is contained in the Holy Scriptures, concerning God, Chriſt, and Salvation, and all other eſſential Principles of true Religion. It is not enough to believe as the Church believes, as ſome ignorantly teach and affirm.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He that hath obtained true Faith, hath had his Underſtanding enlightned, to ſee what his State and Condition was by Nature;<note place="margin">Acts 2.37. 2 Cor. 7.</note> he hath been under Humiliation for Sin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He ſeeth alſo, that all his own Righteouſneſs will avail him nothing in point of Juſtification, and Acceptation with God. Without Chriſt, his Prayers, Tears, Reading, Hearing, and Almſ-deeds, will not ſave him. To truſt to any of theſe, he ſees is the way to make Faith void.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.8. Rom. 10.2, 3.</note> The Jews built upon this Foundation, and thereby miſſed of Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:39531:24"/>5. There is in that Soul where true Faith is wrought, or where the Seed of it is ſowed, a deſire after Chriſt, not ſimply after his Merits, but alſo after Union, and intimate Acquaintance with him. <hi>Yea, doubtleſs, I account all things but Loſs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> 
                        <hi>for the Excellency of the Knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered the Loſs of all things, and do account them but Dung, that I may win Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. A true enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Soul looks firſt to Chriſt's Perſon, as being affected with his Beauty, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Love; and then to the Goods and Riches he poſſeſſeth: As a Woman newly married, looks firſt to her Husband, and then to the Inheritance, or elſe is little better than an Harlot.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But did I ſay, a Deſire after Chriſt? Be not miſtaken, to think that every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after him is a Sign of true Faith. (1.) It is a fervent Deſire; ſuch deſire him more than all the World. That Soul pants after him, and Union with him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 75.25</note> more than after Heaven and Glory. It greatly endears Chriſt to the Soul. <hi>He is the chiefeſt of Ten Thouſand.</hi> (2.) 'Tis ſuch a Deſire, as in a hungry Man, nothing will ſatisfy him but Bread; ſo nothing will ſatisfy a true Believer, but Chriſt, the Bread of Life.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If a Man hath true Faith, he knoweth the Time when he was without it; he knoweth he was once blind, and without God and Chriſt. I will not ſay, he knows the very Inſtant when God wrought it in his Soul; but he can ſay with the Man whoſe Eyes Chriſt opened, <hi>Whereas I was blind, I now ſee.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jon. 9.25.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. And not only ſo, but he knows the Way and Means by which he obtained it, <hi>viz.</hi> either by Hearing, or Reading, or Meditating on the Word of God; either in the free Tender of Chriſt to Sinners in general, or to dejected, burthened, and heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden Sinners, in particular.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Faith is uſually obtained of God in a conſtant and laborious ſeeking and crying to him for it. What Pains hath it coſt you, Sirs? Precious Faith is not eaſily obtained to. What Conflicts have you found within? Satan ever makes ſtrong Reſiſtance, there is nothing he ſtrives to obſtruct or hinder more.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. What Love to God hath thy Faith wrought in thee? True Faith works by Love. <hi>Mary</hi> believed, and loved much.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Hath thy Faith purified thy Heart? Haſt thou ſeen its horrid Filth and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and doſt thou long after Purity? not only to have thy Sins pardoned, but alſo purged away, and the Power and Dominion thereof deſtroyed?</p>
                     <p n="12">12. What Alteration in the Courſe of thy Life hath Faith wrought? Faith made <hi>Jordan</hi> go back. There is a Turning the whole Man to God, a glorious Change in every Faculty, in Heart, and alſo in Life. <hi>Half my Goods,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zacheus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 19.8. Act. 19.19</note> 
                        <hi>I give to the Poor.</hi> And in the <hi>Acts</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>Thoſe that uſed unlawful Arts, burned their Books. If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. Faith leads the Soul to receive Chriſt in all his Offices, not only as a Saviour, but alſo as a Sovereign: not only as a Prieſt, to die, and appeaſe the Wrath of God for us, but alſo as a Prince, to rule and reign in us.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. What Obedience therefore flows from thy Faith? Doſt thou boldly and viſibly profeſs Jeſus Chriſt, following him whitherſoever he goeth; not cloſing in with one of his Precepts only, but obeying all of them from thy Heart, which thou art convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of, and knoweſt to be thy Duty. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. What Peace hath Faith brought to thy Soul? <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> From what hath been noted we may infer, There is an abſolute Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Goſpel-Revelation. <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is no Salvation without it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. Thou muſt be beholden to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for a Righteouſneſs, becauſe thou haſt broken the Law, that pronounceth the Curſe againſt thee; thou haſt none of thy own that will be accepted in the ſight of God. <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs ye believe that I am He,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is a Neceſſity of Faith, becauſe all Boaſting is excluded.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.27</note> God's deſign in our Salvation is, wholly to exalt his own Free-Grace. It is of Chriſt's procurement, and thou muſt go unto him for it, or go without it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly;</hi> If Faith be much more precious than Gold, then labour for it above Gold; be not contented with a little of it, but wiſely provide your ſelves with good Store. Grow in Faith, get a ſtrong Faith.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Will not a ſmall or weak Faith ſave us, as well as a ſtrong?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, if it be of the right kind, tho never ſo ſmall, the Perſon that hath it is as fully juſtified, as he that hath the greateſt degree nd meaſure of it. Yet it concerns thee to get a ſtrong Faith, for theſe Reaſons following:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe thou mayeſt meet with ſtrong Aſſaults and Temptations from Satan, and thou haſt no way to reſiſt him but by the Shield of Faith, and it may be a little Faith will not be ſufficient to withſtand thoſe Exerciſes and Aſſaults thou mayeſt meet with.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe God expects much Faith of thoſe he hath afforded much Means unto: <hi>I looked it ſhould bring forth Grapes.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 5.4.</note> God looks for Fruit, anſwerable to the Coſt and Charge he hath been at with a People, or a particular Perſon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe God may bring you into ſuch a condition, that you may have nothing elſe to live upon,<note place="margin">Hab. 3.17.</note> 
                        <hi>The Fig-Tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither Fruit be in the Vines,</hi> &amp;c. That is a Time for the Saints to live by Faith; and if their Faith be ſmall, what will they do then?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe as thy Faith is more or leſs, ſo will thy inward Peace and Joy be in Chriſt Jeſus. He that hath but a ſmall degree of Faith, is often at the foot of the Hill, and under doubtings and becloudings in his own Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe ſuch as have but little Faith, will find the Way to Heaven harder, and more difficult, than they who have much of it, or are ſtrong in Faith. Weak Folks are hard put to it to get up a high Hill.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Becauſe it is a ſtrong Faith that glorifies God moſt, as it appears in reſpect of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4.19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>He being not weak in Faith, conſidered not his own Body being dead. — He ſtaggered not through <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But what is the Cauſe that ſome Chriſtians are ſo weak in Faith?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some are but juſt brought forth, lately converted, they are like new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Babes: Can you expect a Child in the Cradle, ſhould be as ſtrong as ſuch as are twenty or thirty Years old?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Perhaps ſome have but little Faith, becauſe they want the Means of it, which others have; It may be they have more Law preached to them than Goſpel, more Terror from <hi>Sinai,</hi> than Joy from Mount <hi>Zion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Again, ſome may be weak in Faith, becauſe they pore more upon their own inward Corruptions, than they meditate on Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, more on their own Emptineſs, than on Chriſt's Fulneſs. They ſee their Debts, but have not their Eyes upon their Surety, who hath diſcharged and blotted all out.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Others may have little Faith, becauſe they do not improve that which they have, they are not induſtrious Traders, they do not labour after, and cry to God for more Faith. The way to grow rich, is to be diligent. <hi>Lord, encreaſe our Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Some have no more Faith, becauſe they give way to Temptations, and let their inward Corruptions too much prevail. Weeds will hinder the Growth of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Flowers: Self-Love, worldly Pleaſure, Pride, and Paſſion, choak and obſtruct its Growth. Faith is a tender Herb.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Perhaps Chriſtians have no more, becauſe they mind not thoſe precious Grounds and Encouragements, which God in Mercy hath offered for the encreaſe, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and growing of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How may I know a weak Faith from a ſtrong?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A weak Chriſtian, one weak in Faith, looks more within than without, grounds more on the good Deſires and Heavenlineſſes of his Affection, than the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſe of God:<note place="margin">Joh. 14.19</note> Now a ſtrong Chriſtian looks to Chriſt. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> 'Tis not becauſe my Affections live, my Obedience lives, or I have Life in Obedience, or performance of external Duties, but becauſe Chriſt lives, <hi>By whom I live. Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:39531:25"/>2. A weak Chriſtian conſults more the Power of the Enemy, than he doth the Strength of God, Chriſt, and the holy Spirit; and is much acted by Sence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Means, how this or that ſhould be done:<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.19</note> 
                        <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> But a ſtrong Saint believes in Hope againſt Hope; a ſtrong Faith takes up in the Power, Grace, and Sufficiency of God: <hi>The Lord is on my ſide,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 56.4.</note> 
                        <hi>I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. A weak Faith grows weaker and weaker, and ready to let go its hold at every diſcouragement. If a Corruption or Temptation prevails, all his Hope of Heaven is almoſt gone preſently. Thus it was with <hi>Peter, Help Lord, I periſh.</hi> But ſtrong Faith is rather ſtrengthned thereby; as appears in the Woman of <hi>Canaan.</hi> You may judg of a ſtrong Faith by its Power over the Enemy. <hi>I have written unto you,</hi>

                  <p>Hope is a Divine and Super-natural Grace or Fruit of the holy Spirit, and may be thus deſcribed:</p>
                  <p>Firſt; 'Tis a patient and well-grounded Expectation of whatſoever God hath promiſed. God is the Author of it, called the <hi>Hope of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>the God of Hope.</hi> The Believer is the Subject of this Hope.

                        <hi>FIrſt;</hi> Examine your ſelves, what Hope you have; there is a falſe Hope, as well as a true. What is the Ground of thy Hope?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some Men ground their Hope of Heaven upon outward Proſperity. This is the Worldlings Hope. They conclude God loves them, and will give Heaven to them, becauſe he hath given them ſo much of the Earth, not remembring, that God gives ſome Men their Portion in this Life:<note place="margin">Pſal 17. Luke 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Remember, Son, thou in thy Life time receivedſt thy good Things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:39531:29"/>2. Some ground their Hopes of Heaven upon Civility, and external Righteouſneſs: They live ſober and honeſt Lives, and are not guilty of any groſs Sins. This is the moral Man's Hope, the Phariſee's, the young Man's in the Goſpel; the fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins had this Hope, and yet loſt Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some ground their Hopes of Heaven upon the Merits of their own Works. This is the Papiſts Hope; for tho they place ſome Hope in Chriſt, yet they put Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their own Works. Now this is to caſt Anchor on the Sands. Firſt; That which merits muſt be our own; but none of our good Works are our own. They are our own <hi>ſubjective,</hi> becauſe wrought in us, and they are ours in regard of the Benefit of them; but in reſpect of the Original they are none of ours, they are the Fruits of the Spirit; 'tis God hath wrought all our Works in us. Secondly; They muſt be compleat and perfect, or not meritorious; but the beſt Works performed by us are both impure and imperfect, more Droſs than Gold. Thirdly; That which merits muſt not be due upon any other account; paying Debts is not meritorious: Now there is nothing that we do, or can do, but it is due, 'tis a Debt we owe to God; we owe him all we have, are, or can perform: Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>When you have done all, ſay you are unprofitable Servants.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Hope of Salvation is grounded upon the Promiſes of God.

They highly value every ſpecial Token of his Love. 10. They rejoice in his Preſence. 11. They grieve and mourn at his Abſence. 12. If they have grieved him, cannot reſt till they ſee his reconciled Face again. 13. They love his Image wherever they ſee it; love all the Godly, the pooreſt Saint, as well as the richeſt. 14. They love to be like him in Grace here, as well as in Glory hereafter. 15. They are troubled when he is diſhonoured. 16. They are greatly concerned for his Name, Kingdom, and Intereſt in the World. 17. They often viſit him in Cloſet-Duties. 18. Take great care to pleaſe him. 19. Will ſuffer for his ſake, when called to it. 20. Long for his Appearance.</p>

From Scripture-Practice, which always was by Dipping, as all the Learned that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial acknowledg. 4.

                                 <hi>baptized in their Bed,</hi>) were ſuch as delayed their Baptiſm until their Death-Beds, becauſe they believed it would take away all Sin, and that there was no Pardon if they ſinned after receiving it; yet not daring to go out of the World without this great Badge of Chriſtianity, deferr'd it till they thought they were in danger of Death: And ſince they could not without peril of Life be dipp'd, Sprinkling was invented to ſerve the turn. For a like Reaſon (as was ſaid before) they changed the Mode of Adminiſtration with reſpect to Infants, when their Baptiſm was introduced, out of regard to their tender Conſtitutions, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in cold Countries &amp; Seaſons. This was the Original of Sprinkling, and ſprung purely from the abuſe of Baptiſm, and the Want of the right Subject; as (by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aid) ſhall be demonſtrated in a particular Sheet, impartially, and from undoubted Authority.</p>
                              <p>One may with as much reaſon be ſaid to be buried, when Clay or Earth is thrown upon his Head only; as to be baptized, when Water is poured upon his Head or Face: And if the one be <hi>no Burying,</hi> 'tis as certain the other is <hi>no Baptiſm.</hi> And he that affirms, that Sprinkling may repreſent or ſymbolically expreſs the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, does at the ſame time ſpeak without colour of Truth, Word of Sence, and againſt all the Reaſon in the World. As breaking of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Bread, viſibly betokens that Chriſt's Body was broke; and as the pouring forth of the Sacramental Wine, repreſents the guſhing forth of his Blood: ſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Dipping in Water, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, repreſents his Death and Burial; and the coming from under the Water, his Reſurrection.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</note>

                     <p>FRom the whole we may rationally conclude, That the Adminiſtration of this great Ordinance by Sprinkling, (which comports not with the Literal nor Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Signification of the Word, nor thoſe great Myſteries repreſented by it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt) is diſorderly, and ſhould be rectified.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a Motive to excite us to admire and reverence the great Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, who hath given us ſuch a viſible Symbol of his Death, Burial, and Reſurrection; not only to confirm our Faith, but alſo to prevent our being deceived by any ſeducing Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is not to be wondred at, that ſuch as deny the Man Chriſt Jeſus, but preach up the Light within to be a Saviour, ſhould reject theſe two great Ordinances ſtated in the Scripture, (<hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper) becauſe ſuch as deny the Subſtance, are neceſſitated to deny the Sign. Perſons of this Judgment may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted: For when ever the Term <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is mentioned, and God or Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as the Agent, it muſt be underſtood of the Baptiſm of the Spirit, in the Sence before ſpoken of. When ever Baptiſm is mentioned as the Act of any Apoſtle or Miniſter of the Goſpel, it denotes Water-Baptiſm, becauſe theſe have neither Power nor Commiſſion to baptize with the Spirit, and with Fire. And when ever the Baptiſm of Blood and Suffering is mentioned, it muſt be underſtood of Perſecutors, or ungodly Men, who murther, deſtroy, or afflict the Godly; for neither God (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blaſphemy) nor good Men) without a wrong application of the Term) may be ſaid to baptize that way. So that when we meet with the Act of Baptiſm, as the Act of a good Man, we muſt of neceſſity underſtand it of Water-Baptiſm, in the ſame Method and Mode of Adminiſtration, as was practiſed by the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians; and that being a poſitive Inſtitution, (with reſpect to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Manner of Adminiſtration) is not to be deviated from, upon any pretence whatſoever, unleſs we will ſuppoſe the Laws of the Almighty to be in the Power of Man, ſo as that he may diſpenſe at pleaſure with them; which is not to be done without ſufficient Authority from God himſelf, which is no where to be found.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If the Laws of the great unerring Sovereign of all things are to be obſerved without variation, unleſs it be by his expreſs Direction; then we are to conform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to his Order, in this part of the Evangelical Law, and to practiſe it no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he has preſcribed, becauſe it was once ſo delivered to the Saints.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We would caution all that would approach to this ſacred Evangelical Ordinance, unleſs they be dead to Sin, that is, ſuch as truly and really hate Wickedneſs, and the empty Vanities of the World; and unleſs they have a proſpect of, and long to have an Intereſt in that never-fading Inheritance, promiſed by our dear Lord Jeſus to his Children; not to prophane this bleſſed Inſtitution: Becauſe, if they want the due Qualifications of ſerious and converted Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, Repentance, and good Lives, they are hereby entitled, not real Members of Chriſt, but Hypocrites, and incur as great a Hazard, as ſuch do who eat and drink unworthily of the Lord's Supper.</p>

Which abſurd and monſtrous Conceit of theirs hath been learnedly confuted by many ancient and modern Writers, ſo that it may be thought needleſs to add any thing here upon that account; yet that we may make our way the more plain to theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical and figurative Expreſſions uſed by our Saviour, when he inſtituted the holy Sacr ment of the Supper, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſomething briefly we ſhall offer, in confutation of their pernicious Doctrine; which may ſoon be done, for they confute themſelves, in ſaying, that the Sacrament is a Feaſt for our Souls, and not for our Bodies: Now what is my Soul the better, when I eat the very Body of Chriſt?

                  <p>But to come directly to the Buſineſs in hand: Either Chriſt ſpake figuratively, when he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> or he did not: And that the Words cannot be taken in a proper ſence, is evident; for it is impoſſible for Words to expreſs any thing more plainly, than that by this is meant the Bread.

Do not they affirm, as ſoon as ever it ceaſeth to be Bread, it becometh the real Body of Chriſt?

                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Chriſt's Body is there after the manner of a Spirit, taking up no room, ſo that Head, Hands, Feet, are altogether in the leaſt Crumb of the Hoſt.</hi>

                     <q>In arguing thus, as a learned Man obſerves, they plead for the Propriety of Words, and deſtroy the Propriety of things. How can they ſay it is properly a Body, which wants the eſſential Properties of a Body, which is to have quantity, and take up room; take away this, and the Body may properly be a Spirit, for it is that only which differenceth it from a Spirit.</q>

                  <p>But further, to ſhew how idle and abſurd it is to take our Saviour's Words in a proper Sence, we ſhall ſhew that it is utterly againſt Senſe and Reaſon, as well as contrary to Scripture, as you have heard.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; It is againſt Senſe. What greater Evidence can there be of things, than what Senſe affordeth? But if this which the Papiſts affirm, about the conſecrated Bread being the real Body of Chriſt, be true, the Senſes of all the World are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: For ſince the great Argument for Chriſtianity (as all agree) was the Words that Chriſt ſpoke, and the Works which Chriſt did; now how could we be ſure he did ſo ſpeak, or ſo work, if we may not credit the Reports of our Eyes and Ears? This was St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s great Evidence of the Truth of what he wrote, That it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him by Eye-Witneſſes, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.1, 2. and St. <hi>John</hi>'s: <hi>What we have ſeen with our Eyes, and our Hands have handled of the Word of Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.1. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s for the Reſurrection, <hi>That he was ſeen of</hi> Cephas, <hi>then of the Twelve, then of above five hundred Brethren at once,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.5, 6. Even <hi>Thomas</hi> his Infidelity yielded to this Argument, <hi>That if he did thruſt his hand into Chriſt's Side, he would believe,</hi> Joh. 20.25. Chriſt judged this was a convincing Argument, when the Apoſtles thought they had ſeen a Spirit: <hi>Handle me, and ſee: for a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Blood, as you ſee me have.</hi> Luke 24.39.</p>
                  <p>But now if after the Words of Conſecration, there is under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread, the Nature and Properties of Fleſh, then are the Senſes of the wiſeſt of Mortals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: And if our Senſes be deceived here,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon.</hi>
                     </note> they are not (as a late Author obſerves) to be truſted in any other thing; no, not when they are moſt ſure that we ſee Father or Mother, or Wife, or Children. Can we be ſure, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> is written in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.? For may not thoſe Words be ſome other Words? why ſhould we truſt our Eyes? What if we ſhould tell the Papiſts, Theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are neither in this Chapter, nor any where elſe written in the New Teſtament, and grow confident of it, and tell them the Words are, This is not my Body, 'Tis the Bricks that were laid to build <hi>Babel,</hi> 'Tis the Gates of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Porch: This is the Shew-Bread that <hi>Abimelech</hi> gave to <hi>David,</hi> the Bottles that <hi>Abigail</hi> took from <hi>Nabal?</hi> If they tell us, We are ſtrangely deceived, and the Senſe of all that can read will give it againſt us; may not we tell them as well, when they ſay, This is the real Body of Chriſt, (when it is nothing but a Wafer-Cake) That they are ſtrangely deceived, and that the Senſes of all, that can either ſee, taſte, ſmell, or feel, will give it againſt them? This being ſo, what reaſon is there for them to burn us, becauſe we cannot ſee the Bread to be Chriſt's real Body, more than there is for us to kill them, becauſe they cannot ſee that it is the Gates of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Porch.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; It is againſt Reaſon. And ſhall any conclude, that is any Principle of the Chriſtian Religion, that is contrary to, and utterly againſt Reaſon? For it would make us believe things that are abſolutely impoſſible, and groſs Contradictions. Tho ſome things may be above Reaſon, yet they themſelves confeſs no Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can be againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Object. But they ſay, <hi>We imagine many things impoſſible, that really are not ſo;</hi> and further intimate, <hi>If we can prove any real Impoſſibilities, which this Doctrine forceth them to believe, they will yield to us: For they with us condemn the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Opinion,</hi>

And if this be ſo, what Monſters follow from hence? Can any deviſe greater Abſurdities than they believe, if in very deed they believe what they ſay, and daily affirm?

(none ſure but a Papiſt, who is ſo well skilled in Equivocation, would give ſuch an Anſwer.) Our Saviour every where makes theſe two Oppoſites, his being in the World, and going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>John</hi> 13.1. the Hour was come, that he ſhould <hi>depart out of this World unto the Father.</hi> It ſeems they could have taught him the Art of going thither, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here at the ſame inſtant.

This turns Chriſt's Body into a Spirit; nay, indeed they make his Body more ſpiritual than a Spirit; for a Spirit cannot be in ſeveral Places, divided from it ſelf. The Soul of Man, if it be entire both in the whole, and in every part of the Body; yet it is not divided from it ſelf, nor from its Body, nor can it be in two Bodies at the ſame time, as all confeſs; mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is but a Fig-leaf; for they aſcribe theſe monſtrous Properties to Chriſt's Body before its Reſurrection; for they ſay, the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Sacrament which the Diſciples received whilſt Chriſt lived. Secondly; Chriſt's Reſurrection, tho it heightned the Perfection, yet it did not alter the Nature and Properties of his Body, nor gave it the being of a Spirit; for after he was riſen, he proves that he was no Spirit by this Argument, <hi>Handle me, and ſee: for a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Blood, as you ſee me have.</hi> Luke 24.39. By this it appears, that their Doctrine deſtroyeth the Truth of Chriſt's human Body; at leaſt it deſtroys the main Evidence of it againſt thoſe who affirmed that Chriſt had only a phantaſtical Body, namely, that he was ſeen, and felt, and heard; for the Papiſts ſay, that Senſe is not to be believed. Again, this Doctrine of theirs deſtroyeth the Truth of Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven; for he is not aſcended, if he hath not left this World, but is here in the Sacrament. Nothing can be more clear, than that Chriſt did viſibly and locally leave this World, when he went up into Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9, 10. That being once there, the <hi>Heavens muſt receive</hi> (or contain) <hi>him, until the Time of the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things,</hi> Acts 3.21.

From whence we infer, That whatſoever we do in the Worſhip of God, we muſt ſee we have a Command from God to warrant our Practice, and alſo exactly to do it according to the Pattern he hath left us, or Directions he hath given us; we muſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39531:37"/> not add to, nor diminiſh from, nor alter any thing of the Words of the Inſtitution; if we do, God will not hold us guiltleſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">II.

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why did Chriſt inſtitute this holy Ordinance, and give it to his Diſciples, the very Night in which he was betrayed?</hi>

When is a Cordial more neceſſary, than when the Patient is ready to faint, and his Spirits fail? Chriſt ſaw what a ſad Qualm was coming upon his poor Saints, and therefore gives them this Soul-reviving Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, to bear up their Spirits.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. None but ſuch who are true Converts, or who ſincerely believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for this is an outward Sign of an inward Grace received. Thoſe who have not ſpiritually received Chriſt by Faith, ought not to come to the holy Supper of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It appertaineth to none, but ſuch Converts as are baptized.<note place="margin">Acts 2.40, 41, 42.</note>

                     <p n="3">3. If thou canſt ſay in truth, that thou wouldeſt be made holy, and doeſt labour after it, as well as to be made happy; to be throughly ſanctified, as well as to be ſaved; live to God here, as well as live with God hereafter; to have Sin mortified as well as pardoned.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It ſhews the horrid Nature and Evil of Sin, in that nothing could expiate it, nor ſatisfy the Juſtice of God, or make a Compenſation for it, but the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It ſhews the wonderful Love of God to poor Sinners, in giving up his own dear Son, to die the curſed Death of the Croſs for us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It ſhews the wonderful Love of Jeſus Chriſt; who freely laid down his Life for our ſakes. <hi>Greater Love hath no Man than this,</hi>

                     </p>

                           <hi>FIrſt;</hi> From hence we may infer, that Angels are fit for publick and great Service. They have four Faces, a Man's, a Lion's, an Ox's, and an Eagle's; which ſhew they have all that is requiſite to great Undertakings. They have Wiſdom to conſult, to contrive and manage the Affairs of the World prudentially; they have the Strength of a Lion, to execute; they have the Willingneſs and Faithfulneſs of the Ox, to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39531:45"/> rejoyce the Heart of the Commander, and Patience to undergo the Difficulties of their Work, and Uſefulneſs of the Publick; they are quick-ſighted, to diſcern and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Deſigns of Enemies, and ſpeedily to diſpatch much in a little time, and that with cheerfulneſs. This is meant by their four Faces; which notes their Perfection, and Fitneſs for Service in all Parts of the World; in regard of which they are ſaid to have one Face before, and another behind, and one on each ſide. God ſets forth their Serviceableneſs by theſe Creatures, both rational and irrational; they have the Shapes of Men, Birds, and Beaſts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly;</hi> That ſuitable Perſons ought to be employed in publick and great Service. God employs Angels in the Government of the World, who are wiſe, truſty, ſtrong, and ſpeedy; and you know what Men God calls for in the State, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. viz. <hi>Such as fear God, Men of Truth, hating Covetouſneſs;</hi> and in the Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <hi>Biſhops muſt not lord it over God's Clergy.</hi> They are not Lords, but Servants: they ought not like Princes, to dwell in ſtately Palaces, in Pride and Idleneſs; but daily to ſtudy, and preach God's holy Word, and labour in God's Harveſt, like as an Ox is faithful and laborious to his Owner; not inſtead of Preaching, and ſtriving to build up God's Houſe, plot and contrive Ways to pull it down; and inſtead of feeding, undo and ruin ſuch as are faithful in the Land.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Angels are noble and glorious Creatures, and yet diſdain not to do Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to them that are far beneath themſelves. Man at firſt, when in his Glory, was but a little lower than the Angels; but ſince he ſinned, he is degraded, and fallen as low as Hell; he hath a vile Body, a defiled Conſcience, and a polluted Soul: yet the Angels, that are ſtiled <hi>Gods,</hi> Holy Ones, Elect,<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.5.</note> that are of the Privy-Council of Heaven, theſe bleſſed Creatures are not aſhamed to ſerve and wait upon us, tho we have the ſcent of the Earth and Hell about us, and do often grieve and offend them with our Miſcarriages; yet they deſpiſe us not, but cheerfully miniſter unto us. What Pride is it then in Men, that have Parts, Places, Honour, Greatneſs, Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not to ſtoop to thoſe that are their Inferiors! They have not more Worth in them than an Angel, and Angels condeſcend to ſerve us;<note place="margin">Rom. 12.16.</note> therefore let us not <hi>mind high things, but condeſcend to Men of low Eſtate, and not be wiſe in our own Conceit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly;</hi> There is one thing more remarkable touching their Faces, <hi>viz.</hi> the Faces were ſtretched upward; ſo <hi>Montanus,</hi> and others read it, <hi>They looked up to him that ſate upon the Throne, which was Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Cherubim</hi>'s Faces, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.20, 21. were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Mercy-Seat.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly;</hi> Obſerve, all Creatures depend upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe Angels have the Face of Men, Lions, Oxen, Eagles, and look up to him. If there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it but this, <hi>viz.</hi> Angels in their own Nature look up to Him, it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that all inferior Creatures do depend upon Him, as well as thoſe noble Ones. But when they come in with the Faces of other Creatures looking up, it is a clear Evidence that all depend upon Chriſt. <hi>By him were all things created,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Col. 1.16, 17.</note> 
                           <hi>that are in Heaven and in Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether Thrones, or Dominions, Principalities, or Powers. All things were created by him, and for him, and by him all things conſiſt.</hi>

Which is eaſily detected; (1.) By conſidering of that great Darkneſs, that is in thoſe Heathen Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and People that have not the written Word of God, concerning Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for tho they have the Light of this Candle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Light of their own natural Conſciences, yet know nothing of Chriſt, who was born of the Bleſſed Virgin, nor of his Death and Reſurrection. (2.) By conſidering the abſolute Neceſſity there is of Goſpel-Revelation, and Miniſtration, to make known to Men thoſe glorious Myſteries, according as it is held forth in divers places of Scripture; for if Man's chief and only Teacher were within him, what need was there for Chriſt to ordain and ſend forth his Apoſtles and Miniſters, to preach the Goſpel to the World? and why is Faith ſaid to come by hearing the Word preached.

Conſcience indeed, as an Accuſer and Condemner, came not in until then; for as long as <hi>Adam</hi> obeyed the Commandments of God, there was no cauſe that Conſcience ſhould accuſe him; but as ſooon as he had ſinned, Conſcience flew in his Face.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly;</hi> Conſcience we (1.) ſay is a natural Power, which the Soul of Man hath,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lockier.</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now (ſaith one) whether this Power be in the Underſtanding only, or partly in the Underſtanding, partly in the Will, I find controverted amongſt the Learned, (ſome ſpeak of it as a diſtinct Faculty.)

                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2 3.</note> That is, as if you ſhould ſay, We do view our Ways by the Word of God, which is an Act only of the Underſtanding; and finding them to be in ſome meaſure levell with the holy Rule, we have this comfortable Reflection back upon our ſelves, That our Faith is not a Fancy, but a Faith that works by Love, and alſo ſincere and ſaving. <hi>Paul</hi> confirms the ſecond, That it is a reflect Act of the Underſtanding, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſeconded by the Power of the Holy-Ghoſt: <hi>My Conſcience bearing me Witneſs in the Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> That is, My Conſcience, tranſcendently ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>conded and aſſiſted by the Holy-Ghoſt, doth ſtrongly teſtify to my Soul, that I am full of Bowels towards my Kinſmen after the Fleſh, and could do any thing, or ſuffer any thing for their Good. The Order according to which the Holy-Ghoſt ſtrikes in with Conſcience is this;</p>
                  <p>The Underſtanding makes a double Propoſition, one grounded in the Word of God, the other in the Heart of Man; as thus: <hi>He that keepeth the Commandments of God, truly loves God; but I do keep the Commandments of God:</hi> This is grounded in the Heart of Man, and then draws a Concluſion from both, <hi>Therefore I do love God truly.</hi> This Concluſion, whilſt holy, and drawn from Divine Premiſes, to wit, the Word of God, and true Grace in the Heart, the Spirit of God ſtrikes in with the Soul in making of it, and aſſiſts the weak Soul, ſo that he concludes with ſtrong Confidence, he is ſincere, or loves God in truth; and not only ſecretly aſſiſts, but ſeconds him, and ſaith the ſame thing to Man that his own Spirit doth:<note place="margin">Rom. 8 16</note> 
                     <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God.</hi> If the Premiſes be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt which the Underſtanding makes, (for the Heart makes Propoſitions ſuitable to the Light that is in the intellectual Part) then the Devil, that lying Spirit, ſtrikes in, and ſeconds the Soul in that corrupt Concluſion, which he collects from corrupt Principles concerning himſelf, thereby to ruin and undo the Soul in Ignorance and Unbelief.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly;</hi> This Faculty or natural Power, called <hi>Conſcience,</hi> only appertaineth to Men, and not to any irrational Creatures. Brutes want Reaſon, and therefore are not capable Subjects of Conſcience; yet againſt Reaſon and Conſcience Men often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do worſe than a Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly;</hi> Conſcience is a natural Power in Man, which compares his Ways and Thoughts by ſome Rule; and according as his Ways agree or diſagree with that Rule, ſo anſwerably doth it bear witneſs with or againſt him.</p>
                  <p>If the Underſtanding be enlightned with Truth, to wit, the Word of God, then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience compares the Ways of a Man by a perfect Rule. But if the Underſtanding be enlightned with natural or moral Principles only, then Conſcience compares a Man's Ways according to thoſe Principles only, and ſo by an imperfect Rule.</p>

And many other Examples, both ancient and modern, we meet with, both of Men and Women, that have deſtroyed themſelves, as not being able to bear the cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an accuſing Conſcience; and others from hence have confeſſed their Guilt, and ſo delivered themſelves into the hands of Juſtice.</p>

Take heed how thou carrieſt thy ſelf towards Conſcience, becauſe it hath a Regal Power in thy Soul, a Commiſſion either to accuſe or excuſe: and if he condemns thee as an Unbeliever, or as a falſe Hypocrite, by the Light and Authority of God's Word,<note place="margin">1 John 3.20.</note> God will alſo (aſſuredly) condemn thee (unleſs thou doſt repent) in the great Day.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Conſider what a glorious Mercy it will be, to have ſuch a Friend as Conſcience witneſs for thee, when thou art wrongfully accuſed and condemned by Men. This was that which bore up <hi>Job,</hi> and holy <hi>Paul,</hi> in their Troubles.<note place="margin">Job 27.6. 2 Cor. 1.12.</note> 
                        <hi>My Heart ſhall not reproach me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> Some poſſibly may enquire here, <hi>How a good Conſcience may be known, or what Characters may be given of it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall give you ſome Rules to judg of a good Conſcience, both <hi>Negatively</hi> and <hi>Poſitively.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Negatively.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. A blind, ignorant, and miſguided Conſcience is not a good Conſcience. Some think that God concerns not himſelf with their Actions, takes no notice of their Hearts, Words, or Lives. Others think that God is made up wholly of Mercy, and tremble not at his Juſtice, and ſo conclude it is an eaſy thing to get to Heaven. One (that I have heard of) ſaid, That if it were as eaſy to get the Riches of this World, as it was to get Heaven, he would not care; or to that effect: not remembring that it is as hard to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, (eſpecially for rich Men) as it is for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.23 1 Pet. 4.18</note> and that the Righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved. Others think, that thoſe Men are Fools that make ſuch a Stir and Ado about Religion, thinking that is the beſt Religion that is eaſieſt to the Fleſh, and is moſt free from outward Trouble; whereas the Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.12</note> that <hi>whoever will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> Some think the Laws of Men muſt be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39531:52"/> their Rule in all Matters of Faith and Religion; and whatever Magiſtrates command, muſt be done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. A drouzy and ſleepy Conſcience is not a good Conſcience. A Conſcience that is not throughly awakened, will let a Man alone in Sin; ſuch can ſleep upon the Brink of the greateſt Danger, tho they are juſt falling into the Gulph of Eternity; yea, can ſleep under the moſt awakening Miniſtry; tho Hell-Fire be thrown (as it were) in their very Faces, yet Conſcience giveth them not one Jog.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A guilty Conſcience is not a good Conſcience, when Conſcience flies into a Man's Face for this or that Sin,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> ſome horrid Pollution or other, loved, and lived in.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A ſeared Conſcience, a Conſcience that hath no feeling in it, is not a good Conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A deſpairing Conſcience is not a good Conſcience. Such as think their Sins are greater than God can or will forgive,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.31</note> notwithſtanding Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>All Sins and Blaſphemies againſt the Father and the Son ſhall be forgiven unto Men;</hi> and thoſe, that believe not there is Life for them in Chriſt, make God a Liar.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Poſitively.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Man hath a good Conſcience, that walks uprightly and faithfully to his Light, according to what he knoweth. If he hath only a natural Light, and walks up faithfully to that, then he hath only a natural good Conſcience; there is Moral Sincerity ſpoken of in the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.4.</note> as well as Godly Sincerity. <hi>Abimelech</hi> in this reſpect had a good Conſcience: <hi>In the Sincerity of my Heart, and Innocency of my Hands,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 20.5.</note> 
                        <hi>have I done this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I might ſhew how a natural good Conſcience may be known from a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence evangelically and ſpiritually good; take two or three Hints.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) He whoſe Conſcience is only naturally good, is uſually a proud Man; <hi>Lord, I thank thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 18 11.</note> 
                        <hi>I am not as other Men,</hi> &amp;c. Such ſeek their own Glory, they ſacrifice to their own Net, and burn Incenſe to their own Drag; all centers in Self, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Action is Self. A Saint, when his Gifts are higheſt, his Heart is loweſt; when his Spirit is moſt raiſed, his Heart is moſt humble.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) A Man that hath only a natural good Conſcience, his great endeavour is to ſtill the Noiſe, and ſtop the Mouth of it; but never looks to have the Guilt removed, and Filth waſhed away by Chriſt's Blood; he ſeeth no need of a Saviour: <hi>I was alive once without the Law,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7.11</note> &amp;c. He is like a Child that hath got a Thorn in his Fleſh, who wipeth away the Blood, but taketh no notice or thought how to get out the Thorn. If bare Performance of Duties, whether natural or divine, will ſtill or quiet the Conſcience, the Conſcience is but naturally good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When Conſcience compares a Man's Ways by the perfect Rule of God's Word, by which he walks, and finds it agreeable thereto.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An evangelical good Conſcience findeth a Man as careful of his Duty towards God, as he is of his Duty towards Man; and as careful of his Duty towards Man, as of his Duty towards God.<note place="margin">Acts 24.16</note> 
                        <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have always a Conſcience void of Offence towards God, and towards Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. An evangelical good Conſcience always ſtirs up to Obedience and Conformity to God's Word, from the ſight of the Excellency of it, and Purity that is in it: <hi>Thy Word is very pure,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
                        <hi>therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. He hath a good Conſcience, whoſe Conviction and Trouble for Sin is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, when it is deep, when the Spirit ſearcheth into the bottom: <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 4 29, 39.</note> 
                        <hi>ſee a Man that hath told me all that ever I did. And they were pricked in their Hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. He hath an evangelical good Conſcience, who is troubled for Sin, not ſimply becauſe of Shame, or becauſe of inward Guilt, or fear of Puniſhment, but becauſe God is and hath been offended, his Spirit grieved, and his Soul defiled, and made unlike God; his Trouble riſeth from the ſence of the hainous Nature of Sin.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When Conſcience findeth that no Conviction, either of Sin or Duty, is ſlighted by the Soul,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.80.</note> but tenderly nouriſhed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. When a Man will ſuffer any Puniſhment or Loſs, before he will offer violence to his Conſcience, and ſin againſt God.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When Conſcience cannot find any Sin hid, ſpared, born with, or connived at in the Soul, no ſweet Morſel under the Tongue.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When Conſcience finds a Man the ſame in private that he is in publick, and that he is not of a Phariſaical Spirit, doth nothing to be ſeen of Men, or for vain Glory's ſake.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:39531:52"/>11. When Conſcience cannot find any Duty or Ordinance, which the Soul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, to be neglected, tho he is expoſed to Reproach thereby. To obey God in Baptiſm, is called the Anſwer of a good Conſcience; Conſcience calls for obedience to this, and to all other Ordinances of the Goſpel, when convinced of them.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And laſtly; When Conſcience beareth Teſtimony to a Soul, that it loveth God and Jeſus Chriſt above all things in this World, <hi>&amp;c. He that hateth not Father and Mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> That is, if he hath not a leſſer Love to them; for the leſſer Love in Scripture is called a Hatred, which our Saviour openeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3 9, 10.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Yea doubtleſs I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things but Loſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall a Man get and keep a good Conſcience?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He muſt get his Heart ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.22.</note> 
                        <hi>Let us draw near with a true Heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, having our Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. See that you experience that the Blood of Chriſt hath as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally purged your Conſciences from dead Works,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> as the Blood of Bulls and Goats ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the purifying of the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He muſt take heed of all ſuch things as offend his Conſcience; Conſcience is a very tender thing, the ſmalleſt thing will make it bleed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He muſt take heed of evil aad corrupt Principles; an erring Conſcience is not a good Conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Labour to fit under a Soul-ſearching Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Take heed of vain Glory, and all ſecret Evil; Conſcience prieth into thy moſt inward Thoughts; beware of ſpeculative Sin.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Labour to keep thy Tongue. <hi>Whoſo keepeth his Mouth, and his Tongue, keepeth his Soul from Trouble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Labour to bring thy Heart into every Duty, beware of Hypocriſy.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Do not grieve or offend thy Conſcience in any thing; tho the Matter may be in it ſelf lawful, yet thou muſt not do it, if thou haſt a doubt in thy Spirit about it:<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> 
                        <hi>He that doubteth is damned,</hi> that is, condemned in his own Conſcience. But much more take heed of doing that which is by all owned to be utterly unlawful.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Labour in all Acts to be ſincere. Conſcience hath power to give in Teſtimony concerning thy Integrity; if thy Heart be unſound, and not upright, Conſcience will ſoon diſcover it, and reproach thee for it, and thou wilt not be able to hold out to the end: and ſad will it be to have thy own Conſcience witneſs againſt thee, when thou comeſt to lie on a ſick Bed; an evil Conſcience will be a bad Death-Bed Companion.</p>
                     <p>O how doth this reprove thoſe that ſin, and regard not the Checks and Rebukes of their own Hearts! Conſcience in the great Day will be more than ten thouſand Witneſſes againſt them.</p>

                              <p>1. They are not prohibited Goods.</p>
                              <p>2. They are not counterfeit Goods.</p>
                              <p>3. They are not temporal and corruptible Goods.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> and more directly, they are,</p>
                              <p>1. Soul enriching Commodities, things that are of very great worth and value. <hi>The Merchandize of Wiſdom is better than the Merchandize of Silver,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Prov. 3.14</note> 
                                 <hi>and the Gain thereof than fine Gold.</hi>

                              <p>2. They are needful things, ſuch things as we cannot be without. Some things that Merchants of a City deal in, and fetch from afar, tho they are of great value, yet we may very well ſubſiſt, and live comfortably without them, as Pearl, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there is an abſolute Neceſſity of all thoſe things the Citizens of this City trade in and for.</p>
                              <p>3. They are ſuch Commodities as will make the Nations and Perſons that buy them happy for ever; and indeed there is no true Happineſs without them.</p>

                              <p>The ſecond thing, is a Soul-converting Goſpel, and bleſſed Ordinances. <hi>The Law goeth forth of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem, Mic. 2.4.</p>
                              <p>The third thing they deal in, are the Gifts and Soul-enriching Graces of the Spirit, Hope, Love, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> things of very great worth.</p>

                              <p>The fourth is Juſtification; every true Sinner makes it his Buſineſs to get this precious Treaſure.</p>
                              <p>The fifth thing is the Peace of God, which paſſeth all Underſtanding, one of the rareſt Commodities in the World.</p>
                              <p>The ſixth thing is, Union and Communion with God.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.3.</note>

                              </p>
                              <p>The ſeventh thing is, Peace of Conſcience: <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf,</hi>

                              <p>The eighth thing is, Sanctification, or a holy Life; they who trade not in this Commodity, are none of the true Sons and Citizens of <hi>Zion.</hi>

They cannot indeed deſtroy the Church, but they can bring it into a narrower Compaſs, and drive it into Holes. The Church (ſaith <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) is like the Moon, which ſometimes ſhines wholly, being enlightned with the Sun-beams, and ſometimes is deprived of a great part of her Light; ſo the Church ſhines ſometimes moſt gloriouſly, and ſometimes is ſo obſcured that ſhe hardly appears at all.</cell>

Thirdly; But this not taking ſo effectually neither, they were moſt cruelly oppreſſed by hard Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and forced to make their full Tale of Bricks, and yet Straw is denied them; which made the Lives of God's People bitter unto them.

                           <cell>IX. So the Church or Houſe of God hath a Way that readily leads to it. In a ſtrict Sence, Chriſt is both the Way and the Door. If any enquire more directly, how they may find the Way into the Church, if they take the Counſel of the Holy-Ghoſt, they cannot miſs. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand in the Ways, and ſee, and ask for the old Paths,</hi>

In a Family, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ought to know his Place, and all the reſt to be in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or elſe great Confuſion and Diſorder will break forth.

                           <cell>VII. So it is a great Honour to the Church of God, when it is well and wiſely governed. In this reſpect <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily a Type of the Family of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or Church of God.

What is any Society of Men, without Rule, and good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Strict Diſcipline muſt be kept up in Chriſt's Family.

                              <p>5. They ought to know the State of the Flock,<note place="margin">Prov. 27.23. Heb. 13.17</note> and to watch over every Member thereof.</p>
                              <p>6. The Members of the Church ought to ſtudy their Duty,</p>
                              <p>(1.) To their Paſtor, to provide for him a ſufficient Maintenance,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.9, to 14.</note> that he may not be encumbered with worldly Affairs, and thereby made unfit for his great Work and Buſineſs he is called to. <hi>See Planters, Labourers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                              <p>(3.) As to their Duties one to another, as Fellow-Members of God's Church, it is needful for them to know how they ſhould carry and behave themſelves towards their offending Brethren. And as touching this, it is neceſſary to conſider, 1. The Rule touching private Offences. 2. Touching publick and ſcandalous Offences and Offenders.</p>
                              <p>1. Touching private Offences, Chriſt hath left us Directions, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16. <hi>If thy Brother offend thee, tell him his Fault between thee and him alone; but if he will not hear thee, take one or two more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if he ſtill neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church: But if he will not hear the Church, then he is fit for Church-dealing, or Excommunication.</hi> Let all take heed they do not make publick any Evil or Offence of their Brethren, that is private; for this is an utter Fault, and a Violation to the Law of Chriſt, and Order of his Houſe.</p>
                              <p>2. Touching publick and ſcandalous Sins and Offenders, ſuch as expoſe the Name of God to a Reproach, as Fornication, Covetouſneſs, Idolatry, Drunkenneſs, Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe, without thorow and unfeigned Repentance, ought forthwith to be delivered up to Satan, or put out of the Church, into the Kingdom of Satan,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.5</note> from whence they came. And truly it cannot be known quickly who hath true Repentance, that fall into ſuch great Sins, until there be ſome Time of Trial. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Life is the chief part of Repentance; therefore to clear the Name of God from Reproach, and the better to bring the Offender to the Sence of his Sin, the Ordinance of Excommunication ought, in my Judgment, immediatly upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, to paſs againſt him.</p>
                              <p>3. In the Adminiſtration of Juſtice and Judgment in the Church, ſpecial Care ought to be taken, that with all Wiſdom and Impartiality Perſons may be dealt withal. Let the Church and Paſtor ſee to it, that the Rich be no more ſpared than the Poor. <hi>Levi</hi> was not to know his Father in Judgment.</p>

                              <cell>IV. So a dear Child of God doth not only love God, who is his Father, but alſo dearly loves the Church, who is his Mother. Thus did <hi>David,</hi>

                     <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> it is to be underſtood of a Chriſtian, that is engaged to fight the good Fight of Faith, under the Command of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the Enemies of the Soul. This Title is not appropriated only to Miniſters, (it is not a diſcriminating Title, only to diſtinguiſh them from other Saints, as the Title of <hi>Ambaſſador, Paſtor, Watchman,</hi> &amp;c.) but a Title that belongs to every Chriſtian, and Profeſſor of Chriſt.

                           <cell>SO every true Chriſtian liſteth himſelf under the Command of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Captain of our Salvation; He gives up his Name to him, to ſerve him in all Uprightneſs, as becometh a faithful Souldier to do, making a ſolemn Covenant with Chriſt, and his People, to be on their ſide; and this is viſibly done in Baptiſm.</cell>

                           <cell>II. So a true Chriſtian forſakes all, and follows Chriſt; he becomes dead to this World; he is crucified to it, and that many times to him. His Heart is not ſet upon Things below,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1, 2.</note> but upon Things above; he looks upon Religion and Godlineſs, as his great Work and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>They that are after the Fleſh,</hi>

                           <cell>III. So a true Chriſtian alſo is no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner converted, liſted, and entred into Chriſt's Company, <hi>viz.</hi> his Church, but he is armed likewiſe. He puts on the whole Armor of God, hath his Loins girt about with Truth, and hath the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Righteouſneſs, his Feet ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace,<note place="margin">Eph. 6 10, 11, 12.</note> the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. And becauſe moſt of thoſe Parts or Pieces of a Chriſtian's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor are ſpoken to and opened under that Head of Metaphors reſpecting the Graces of the Spirit, we ſhall ſpeak no more of it here.</cell>

                           <cell>IV. A Souldier is known by his Habit, Armor, and Weapons, from other Men; they put off their own Clothes, and put on the King's, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if poor and ragged when they are liſted.</cell>
                           <cell>IV. So a true Chriſtian is known by the Clothes he hath on, from the Wicked and Ungodly of the World. He is cloathed with the Garment of Holineſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; and hath on all the precious Graces of the Spirit, as Armor of Proof, faſt girt to him by the Girdle of Sincerity; and this ſhews him to be one of Chriſt's Souldiers.</cell>

                           <cell>V. Souldiers many times are cloathed at the King's Charge; and it is greatly for the Honour of a Captain, to have all his Men brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloathed, and glittering in their Armor.</cell>
                           <cell>V. So Chriſt cloaths all his Souldiers, and they are all attired alike, cloathed in white. Their Robes coſt dear, <hi>viz.</hi> the Price of his own moſt precious Blood; and it greatly tends to his Honour, to have them kept clean, and without Spot or Stain, all glittering in their ſpiritual Armor, <hi>viz.</hi> adorned with the bleſſed Graces of the Spirit.</cell>

                           <cell>VI. So it is a Reproach to a Chriſtian, to aim at Self in all he doth in Religion. Many Men care not to do any thing for the Honour of God, further then it makes, as they conceive, directly for their own Intereſt and Advantage. Tell ſome Men of this or that Ordinance and Command of Chriſt, they preſently object, May I not be ſaved without it? Is it neceſſary to Salvation? Theſe Men only make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as a Bridg to carry them to Heaven; meer mercenary Souls! Alas! a true Chriſtian obeys and ſerves Chriſt ſincerely, that he may glorify and honour his holy Name, knowing he deſerves more at his hands, than he is ever able to perform, not doubting his Labour ſhall ever be in vain in the Lord; the very Work is Wages to him. <hi>Paul</hi> was reſolved, <hi>Chriſt ſhould be magnified in his Body, whether it were by Life, or by Death.</hi>

The Devil, called the King of the Bottomleſs Pit, Prince of the Power of the Air, the great Dragon, the Captain-General of the black Regiment, and of the Helliſh <hi>Militia,</hi> that makes War againſt the Lamb, and his Followers.

                              <p>(1.) The Things of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pleaſures, Honours, and Profits of the World.

                              <p>(2.) The Men of the World, who are the Subjects of the Prince of Darkneſs, and his Souldiers, the Militia of Hell, and the Auxiliaries of Satan, the Seed of the Old Serpent, who are filled with Enmity againſt the Woman's Seed.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.44</note>

                              <p>(3.) The Worſhips of the World. Saints have been often expoſed to great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for oppoſing the Ways, Inventions, and Superſtitions of Men, the Worſhip of the Beaſt, and curſed Fornications of the great Whore; but whilſt they are able to ſtand, or have Life in them, they muſt oppoſe and reſiſt all falſe Ways and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſuch as ſtrive to make void the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the Commands of God, by their Traditions.</p>
                              <p>(4.) There are alſo the Luſts of the World, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, which Saints are engaged to fight againſt, and oppoſe.<note place="margin">1 John 2.16.</note>

                           <cell>VIII. So a Saint expects, and therefore ought to make ready to meet with ſpiritual Oppoſition from the Enemies of the Soul, as ſoon as ever he is liſted, and entred into Chriſt's Service. As it fell out with the Captain himſelf, who no ſooner was baptized,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> but preſently he was <hi>led into the Wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil:</hi> So a Chriſtian muſt always be prepared and reſolved to engage and fight them: <hi>Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſtly in the Faith.</hi>

                           <cell>IX. A Believer goeth not out in the Spiritual Warfare at his own Charge. Chriſt furniſheth him with Clothes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, Weapons, and with all Things needful and neceſſary, all is managed by his gracious and bleſſed Spirit.</cell>

                        <row>
                           <cell>X. A Souldier ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, and well-skill'd in Martial Diſcipline, to know all the Poſtures of War, particularly the Word of Command, and to obey preſently: He muſt not diſpute the Matter, nor make the leaſt Pauſe. Thoſe Souldiers that were under the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, were very tractable upon this account, as himſelf confeſſed: <hi>I ſay to one,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Mat. 8.9.</note>

                           <cell>X. So a Saint ought to be well-skill'd in all things neceſſary for a Chriſtian Souldier; it requires much Wiſdom and Experience; he muſt underſtand the Word of Command, and be ready to obey his Captain, as ſoon as ever the Word is given. <hi>David</hi> had learned this part well: <hi>I made haſte,</hi>

Military Diſcipline hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed every Officer in the Army his proper Place, and every private Souldier to abide in the ſame Rank and File, or Place where he is ſet by his Commander: and none may alter their Station, or change their Poſtures upon their own private account; they muſt not break their Order upon their Peril: for that is a Diſhonour to the Captain, and Standers by will laugh and reproach him; beſides, if it be in a Time of Battel, he expoſeth himſelf and others to great Danger. If an

                           <cell>XI. So muſt a Saint know his Place and particular Station, where he is ſet by his Captain, the Lord Jeſus. If he be ſet as a File-leader, or made an Officer to lead a Party, it is needful for him to ſee to his proper Work and Buſineſs; he may not acquit his Command when he pleaſeth. The Commander in chief may prefer or degrade his Souldiers, as ſeemeth good to him; but he may not, he cannot diſpoſe of himſelf. Paſtors muſt keep their Places, Deacons keep their Places, Members of each Church keep their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not when they pleaſe withdraw themſelves, and get into another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but muſt abide under particular Command, where Chriſt hath ſet them. Shall any one think, that God, who hath placed ſuch Order in other Creatures in Heaven and Earth, is not ſtrict touching
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:39531:91"/> that holy Order ſet and appointed in his Church? If the Sun, Moon, and Stars keep in their own Sphere, and move in their own Orbs; if the Sea hath its Bounds and Limits ſet, beyond which it muſt not go; can it be imagined, that the Church of Chriſt ſhould be a more diſorderly Piece, than the inanimate and irrational Creatures? <hi>God is the God of Order, and not of Confuſion,</hi>

Beſides, the Danger they are expoſed to, if Saints neglect Prayer, or hearing the Word, or the Lord's Supper, or are divided amongſt themſelves, is very great; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they rally the ſooner, and unite again, and keep their Ranks, they are in danger of being utterly routed and undone by Satan.

Their Adverſary the Devil is compared to a Serpent upon this very account; and in other Places we read of his Devices and Wiles: <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>That ye may ſtand againſt the Wiles of the Devil.</hi>

Now becauſe it ſhews Ingenuity, and Acuteneſs of Wit, ſo to compoſe a Diſcourſe; therefore it is transferred to expreſs the Subtilty of Satan, in laying of his Plots againſt a Chriſtian.</q> Indeed the expert Souldier hath his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as well as the Scholar; there is Method in forming an Army, as well as in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming an Argument. The Devil is a ſubtil Enemy, and Saints are moſt endangered by his Craft and Policy; he hath always got the greateſt Advantage upon Chriſt's Souldiers by this means. It was the way he took when he ſet upon Man at firſt, and if he overcame him when he was in his perfect State, no marvel if he prevail upon him in his depraved and maimed State. And therefore Wiſdom is needful, and more eſpecially to diſcover his Stratagems:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11.</note> 
                                 <hi>We are not ignorant</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>of his Devices:</hi> Some of which I ſhall note here, for the ſpiritual Souldier's Profit and Obſervation, with reſpect to his drawing Men and Women to Sin.</p>
                              <pb n="153" facs="tcp:39531:91"/>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Firſt;</hi> He ſhews his Subtilty, in chuſing the moſt proper and advantagious Seaſon for Tempting. An hundred Souldiers at one time may turn a Battel, and ſave an Army, when Thouſands will not do it at another. Satan knows when to make his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and the Time when he is moſt likely to prevail.<note place="margin">Gurnal.</note> The Time he takes to tempt in, is:</p>
                              <p n="1">1. When newly converted. No ſooner is the Child of Grace, the new Creature born, but this Dragon pours a Flood of Temptations after it.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. When a Saint is beſet with ſome great Affliction; this is a blind Lane, or ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Place, fit for this Thief to call for his Purſe.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. When a Chriſtian is about ſome notable Enterprize for God's Glory, then Satan will lie like a Serpent in the Way: <hi>An Adder in the Path, that biteth his Horſe Heel,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Gen. 49. Zech. 3.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                                 <hi>ſo that his Rider ſhall fall backward.</hi> Thus he ſtood at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Right-hand, to reſiſt him. The Right-Hand is the working Hand, and his ſtanding there, implies his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to hinder him, and his Enterprize. Indeed the Devil was never a Friend to Temple-Work, and therefore that Work is ſo long a doing. What a handſom Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe doth he help the Jews unto? <hi>The Time is not come.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Hag. 1 2. Mat. 4.1, 2.</note> When our Saviour was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and was juſt entring upon his Miniſtry, then Satan ſet upon him.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. When he hath the Preſence of ſome Object to enforce his Temptation. Thus he took <hi>Eve,</hi> when ſhe was near the Tree, and had it in her Eye.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. After great Manifeſtation of God's Love, then the Tempter comes. Such is the Weakneſs of Grace ſometimes in a Believer, that he can neither well bear Smiles nor Frowns from God. When <hi>Paul</hi> was exalted with abundance of Revelation,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.1, 2, 3 &amp;c.</note> then was the Time that Satan ſet upon him with his ſtrong Temptations.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. At the Hour of Death; Satan knows, that if he cannot prevail then, he never can. 'Tis the laſt Onſet, and therefore he reſolves to try his Skill. If he cannot break his Head, ſo as to keep him out of Heaven; yet he will (if poſſible) bruiſe his Heel, and ſend him limping thither: I mean, fill a Saint full of Fears and Doubts about his eternal State.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Secondly;</hi> He hath many other Stratagems to deceive by Temptations.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. He hangs out falſe Colours, and comes to a Saint in the diſguiſe of a Friend; he transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light: <hi>Maſter, pity thy ſelf.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. He ſtrives to get Intelligence of a Saint's Affairs. This (ſaith my Author) is one great Wheel in this Politician's Clock, to have Spies in all Places, by whom they are acquainted with the Counſels of their Enemies. He labours to find out what Sin it is that moſt eaſily beſets a Perſon, or that he is moſt prone to.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note>
                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. In his gradual Approaches to the Soul. When he firſt comes to tempt, he is modeſt, and asks but little, knowing he may get that at many times, which he ſhould be denied, if he ſhould ask it all at once. A few Men are let into a City, when an Army, coming in a Body, would be ſhut out. Remember, he draws to Sin by little and little: Firſt it may be the Thought of this or that Evil is darted into the Mind, and after a while lodged quietly there, and then a little after further Proceed is made in Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="4">4. Satan, like a cunning Warrier, hath his Reſerves; like a wiſe Captain, he hath ſome freſh Troops at hand, if need be: So that if one Temptation will not prevail, he hath a ſecond, nay, a third and fourth, nay Multitudes. What freſh and new Attempts did he uſe, when he ſet upon our Saviour?</p>
                              <p n="5">5. Another Stratagem of his is this: He will in a politick way retreat, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you ſhall have an Enemy flie as overcome, when it is on a deſign of overcoming. We read not only of Satan's being caſt out, but of the unclean Spirit's going out voluntarily; yet be ſure it was with a purpoſe to return more ſtrong than before.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. He will ſtrive to make uſe of fit Inſtruments to carry on his Temptations to the Ruine of the Soul. I might proceed, but by this all may ſee, That it is needful for the Chriſtian Souldier to be well inſtructed in the Stratagems of War.</p>

                              <p n="1">1. The Goodneſs of his Cauſe. Nothing adminiſtreth more Life and Zeal to a Saint, than the Conſideration of that holy Cauſe, which in the Strength of Chriſt he ſtands up for, and is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              <p n="3">3. A good Call. Every Chriſtian, in all his Enterprizes, muſt ſee to his Call; let him ſee that whatſoever he doth in Religion, both in matter and manner, it is what God hath enjoined him. He that undertakes any Work or Cauſe, that is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by God's Word, hath cauſe to tremble. And alſo let him ſee he is the Man that God approves of, and hath employed in and about that Work and Duty, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be; and when he ſees that his Call is undeniably good, this will add Courage to him.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. A good Conſcience. This made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo bold in the preſence of his incenſed Adverſaries: <hi>Men and Brethren,</hi>

'Tis Innocency and Uprightneſs that puts Life and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity into a Chriſtian. <hi>Having a good Conſcience, that whereas they ſpeak Evil of you,</hi>

                           <cell>XVI. A Souldier muſt expect to endure Hardneſs, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares himſelf for it. It is a Life at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many Hardſhips and Difficulties; they often lie in the Field, and fare hard, when others know the want of nothing.</cell>

                              <p>XVI. So the Saints of God muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to endure Hardneſs. A Chriſtian's Life is attended with many Difficulties and Afflictions, which they muſt endure as good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt. He is no good Souldier, that cannot endure Hardneſs. But here it may not be amiſs to enquire, What is that Hardneſs that the Saints do and muſt endure?</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Firſt;</hi> They muſt endure all that Hardneſs, that either their Sins, or the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, may expoſe them unto.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Saints are expoſed to Hardſhips by means of their Sins; their own Iniquities bring great Sorrow and Trouble upon them. It made <hi>David</hi> many times cry out, and water his Couch with Tears.</p>
                              <p n="2">
                                 <pb n="155" facs="tcp:39531:92"/>2. Sin is not ſweet to a Saint in the committing of it. He is overcome ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to do that which he hates, and his own Conſcience afterwards ſorely laſhes and wounds him for it. Sin brings not only Hardſhips upon the Soul, but many times ſore Diſtreſs upon the Body and Family, and a Blaſt upon a Man's outward Eſtate.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Secondly;</hi> A Saint meets with the Hardſhip of Self-denial; he bears the Pain of having a Right-hand-Luſt cut off, and a Right-eye Luſt pulled out; he parts with the beſt, the neareſt, and choiceſt of his outward Enjoiments. <hi>

                                 <hi>Thirdly;</hi> They endure the Hardneſs of Mortification, or of crucifying the Fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts. Circumciſion was painful to the Body, and let me tell you, the Circumciſion of the Spirit is more hard and difficult to a Saint to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go; <hi>Which is made without hands; cutting off the Foreskin of the Heart, or putting away the Body of Sin by the Circumciſion of Chriſt. Mortify your Members which are upon the Earth.</hi> The killing of Sin, is as the killing or deſtroying the Members of the Body.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Fourthly;</hi> Saints endure Hardneſs from Men.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. By hard Words. All the cruel Reproaches, Slanders, Revilings, Tauntings, Scoffings, Backbitings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Sons of <hi>Beliál</hi> can invent, they are forced to endure. <hi>They bend their Tongues like their Bow for Lies, and their Tongue is as an Arrow ſhot out.</hi> The Tongues of ſome Men are like cruel Weapons: <hi>As with a Sword in my Bones, my Enemies reproach me,</hi> &amp;c. The Sword in the Fleſh is painful,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.10. Heb. 11.36.</note> but the Sword in the Bone is much worſe. Mockings are ranked amongſt the great Sufferings of the Godly: <hi>Others had Trials of cruel Mockings.</hi> The Archers this way ſhot hard at <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and what a poyſonous Arrow did the Jews let flie upon Chriſt! <hi>Behold a Drunkard, a Wine-bibber, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners. He caſteth out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>the Prince of Devils. As for this Fellow, we know not from whence he is. Paul</hi> was accuſed for being a <hi>peſtilent Fellow, a Mover of Sedition, and a Ring-leader of the Sect of the Nazarens,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe things are hard to bear.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. There is the Hardneſs of Mens Hands, as well as of their Tongues.

Some Afflictions come more immediatly from the Hand of God. <hi>Job</hi> complains of the Arrows of the Almighty; <hi>David</hi> cries out, as if the Lord had broke his Bones. Yet God in all the Afflictions and Trials he brings upon his People, deſigns their Profit: <hi>When he hath tried me, I ſhall come forth as Gold.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Job 23.</note> It is that we may be Partakers of his Holineſs. Yet nevertheleſs the Strokes and Chaſtiſements of the Almighty are hard to be borne.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Seventhly;</hi> Chriſt's Souldiers meet with Hardneſs, whilſt they attend upon their proper Work, in their particular Places and Stations unto which they are called. Some have harder Service than others; as the Forlorn Hope, and the Van (ſaith one) may meet with harder Service than the main Body of the Army; the Frontiers, and File-Leaders, may meet with more difficult Service than the Rear; and the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that lie Perdue, and ſtand Sentinel; with harder Duty than thoſe that abide on the Guard. But tho ſome endure more Hardneſs than others, yet all muſt take what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:39531:93"/> befalls them in the Place and Station where they are ſet. The Miniſters of the Goſpel (likely) are the Men moſtly expoſed, and yet ſometimes others ſuffer as hard things as they; yet every one muſt ſee to diſcharge his Duty in his reſpective Place. The Sentinel muſt not quit his Watch, becauſe it is cold, or Danger approaches; the File-Leader muſt not face about, and fall back in the Rear, becauſe of the Hardneſs of the Service; the Leaders muſt not bid the private Souldiers fall on, and themſelves run away; the Colours are moſt aimed at, yet the Standard-bearer and Enſign muſt ſtand by them, and diſplay them in the Face of the Enemy. So whatever comes, Miniſters muſt preach, and People muſt hear, and the Publick Worſhip of God muſt be maintained, the Banner of the Word muſt be diſplayed, Saints muſt keep their Ground and Station, where they are ſet by Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> 
                                 <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me; and wo is me, if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi>

                              <p>XVII. So the faithful and good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Jeſus Chriſt is not haled, dragged or forced to his Duty, and to undergo Difficulties for the Goſpel-ſake; but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with a ready Mind engages in the Work. <hi>I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to die at</hi> Jeruſalem,<note place="margin">Acts 21.13</note> 
                                 <hi>for the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Chriſt cares not for preſs'd Souldiers, his are all Volunteers: When the Goſpel-Trumpet ſounds, Come away, come up hither, immediately they are upon their Feet.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. They endure patiently, taking their Captain for their Example: <hi>When reviled, they revile not again. In Patience poſſeſs ye your Souls.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. They endure the Hardneſs of their Service couragiouſly:<note place="margin">Heb. 10 34 Prov. 28.1.</note> 
                                 <hi>They took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods. The Wicked flie when none purſue, but the Righteous are as bold as a Lion. Shall ſuch a Man as I fly?</hi> was the Saying of a brave Souldier of this Captain's. When <hi>Modeſtus,</hi> the Emperor's Lieutenant, threatned <hi>Baſil</hi> with Confiſcation of Goods, Baniſhment, and Death, how couragiouſly did he bear it! <hi>If you have any thing elſe, threaten it; for theſe things are nothing.</hi> This was ſomewhat like that of <hi>Paul;</hi> notwithſtanding Bonds, Impriſonment, and Death was threatned againſt him, yet ſaith he, <hi>None of theſe things move me,</hi>

                              <p n="4">4. Saints endure Hardneſs conſtantly; the whole Life of a Chriſtian is a Time of Warfare: till this Life is done, his Warfare is not done.<note place="margin">Job 17.9.</note> 
                                 <hi>The Righteous ſhall hold on their Way, and he that hath clean Hands, ſhall grow ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> A Saint muſt never ceaſe being a Souldier; Godlineſs muſt be his Trade as long as he lives. As Satan will never have done tempting, ſo he muſt never ceaſe from reſiſting his Temptations.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. And then all this is done ſincerely; he hath holy Aims and Ends in what he doth.</p>

                           <cell>XVIII. A good Souldier ſpares none of the Enemy, when he hath ſuch a Command given him: And <hi>Saul,</hi> for not complying with the Requirement of God in this reſpect, loſt his Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſparing <hi>Agag</hi> the King, and the Fat of the Cattel, when the Word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> 
                              <hi>Go, ſmite</hi> Amalek, <hi>and utterly deſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not; but ſlay both Men and Women, Infant and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Oxen and Sheep, Camels and Aſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</cell>
                           <cell>XVIII. So a Saint, or good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt, ſpares not one Luſt: Every Sin, like the curſed <hi>Amalekites,</hi> muſt be put to the Sword. He is no ſound Chriſtian, that ſuffers any Sin to abide quietly in his Heart or Life unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. If there be any one Darling-Luſt ſpared, it is a palpable Sign of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy. Some Men are ready to excuſe their evil Luſts, as <hi>Saul</hi> did: They will cover their covetous Deſigns under the Pretence of doing good, and diſtributing to the Neceſſities of the Poor; but alas! this will not do, <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice.</hi> A Saint muſt kill all, put all his Sins to the Sword, or die to them. One Sin ſpared, as <hi>Agag</hi> was, will exclude thee the Kingdom of Heaven:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13</note> 
                              <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if ye mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi>

                           <cell>XIX. A good Souldier will keep with his Colours. It is puniſhable by Martial Law, for a Souldier to lie behind his Colours; and Death without Mercy to depart quite from them.</cell>
                           <cell>XIX. So a good Souldier of Chriſt will keep and abide with the Banner of Truth. The Goſpel (ſaith <hi>Ainſworth</hi>) is the Saints Enſign:<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.26.</note> 
                              <hi>And he will lift up an Enſign to the People,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt will laſh ſuch as lie behind. <hi>Peter</hi> was made to weep bitterly for ſtraying from his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. And it will be Death without Mercy to thoſe that quite depart from the Truth, and embrace Hereſy or Idolatry. And here let me caution all Chriſtians to take heed, leſt they are deceived by their Enemies. Satan, like a cunning Pirate, ſometimes transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light, he puts out falſe Colours, comes with a ſeeming Banner or Enſign of Truth; he can make uſe of Scripture, when it will make for his purpoſe to deceive.</cell>

                        <row>
                           <cell>XX. A good Souldier will not turn his Back upon the Enemy, to the diſhonour of his Captain; tho his Life be in danger, he will not flie, nor cowardly betray his Truſt.</cell>
                           <cell>XX. So a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt will not turn his Back to flie from the Enemy, or utterly depart from the Truth, whatſoever befalls him; ſuch is his Love to the Lord Jeſus, and Zeal for his Glory. And beſides, he knows (if he doth) the great Danger he expoſeth his own Soul to thereby: for among all the Armor that Chriſtians ſhould take unto them, we read of no Back-piece; for if they turn their Back,, they are gone and undone for ever: <hi>If any Man draw back,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 10.38</note>

                           <cell>XXI. A Souldier is greatly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and encouraged in all his Encounters and ſharp Conflicts with the Enemy, by conſidering the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Honour he ſhall receive, if he manfully holds out, and gets the Victory.</cell>
                           <cell>XXI. So a Saint is carried on with much Zeal and Courage, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the eternal Reward he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the end.

                           <cell>XXII. Some Souldiers of an Army are now and then ſingled out as Champions, to engage an Enemy alone.

What Joy and Comfort is this to Believers, to hear that all their Enemies are conquered; your Captain-General hath broken them all to pieces.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Enemy cannot hurt you;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28</note> the worſt you can meet with will work for your Good.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Conſider, Tho you meet with hard Things, Chriſt can and will make them eaſy to you. All your Wounds he can heal, and all your broken Bones he can ſet. The more you ſuffer for Chriſt, the greater your Reward will be.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Conſider what great and glorious Pay you ſhall have in the end. Is not a Kingdom, a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away, worth fighting and ſtriving for?</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Look to Chriſt, remember what he hath done and ſuffered for you; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what many Saints have endured for his ſake before you, that were moſt precious in God's ſight. Is it not better to ſuffer here, than to ſuffer in Hell? What is the Pain and Sorrow of the Godly in this Life, to the everlaſting Pains and Torments of the Damned in the World to come? Get much Faith, and provide your ſelves with all your Armor, and the right Uſe of it, the Nature of which is opened under the <hi>Fifth Head.</hi> Get your Hearts looſe from the World: <hi>No Man that warreth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.4</note> 
                        <hi>entangleth himſelf with the Affairs of this Life.</hi> Labour for much Love to God. It was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Saying of Mr. <hi>Bland</hi> the Martyr, when he was at the Stake: <hi>This Death</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is more dear to me than Thouſands of Gold and Silver; ſuch Love, O Lord, haſt thou laid up in my Breaſt, that I hunger for thee.</hi> Take heed you conſult not with carnal Reaſon; rely wholly upon Chriſt, and never conſult thy preſent Strength with thy future Sufferings. Take heed you do not overvalue your Lives. Alas! you cannot live long; what if you die a little ſooner than you might do according to the Courſe of Nature? Alſo conſider, is it not better if God calls you to it, to glorify him by dying, than to die otherwiſe? Remember, You are not your own; let God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make what Improvement of you he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly; Pray continually, pray always, for this is the way to overcome. Prayer hath done wonderfully. And this is one great Thing that is enjoined on the Chriſtian Souldier.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When a Saint hath any great Work to do for God, or eminent Buſineſs and Service for his Church. See <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.2, 9. When <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant had ſpecial Work to do for his Maſter, he was much in Prayer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When a Saint is in the dark concerning any one Truth of God, and cannot get Satisfaction,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> then 'tis a Time for extraordinary Prayer. When <hi>Daniel</hi> was at a loſs about the Time of Deliverance out of Captivity, how much did he give himſelf to Prayer!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When a gracious Soul is under any ſore and grievous Affliction. <hi>David</hi> in his Diſtreſs and Affliction cried mightily to God. <hi>Is any afflicted? let him pray;</hi> that is, let him be more abundantly in that Duty. <hi>James</hi> 5.13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When Sin abounds, or in a Day of great Rebuke and Blaſphemy: When Hell ſeems to be let looſe, or the Flood-gates of Wickedneſs opened wide in a Nation, then it is a Time for the Godly to be much in Prayer. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.23.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In Times of great Diſtreſs upon the Church; when the Danger is imminent, as at this Day; this is a Time for extraordinary Prayer. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. When many Nations came up againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> then <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> cried mightily to Heaven, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. When <hi>Haman</hi> plotted to deſtroy all the Jews, and cut off <hi>Iſrael</hi> at once, and the Writings were ſealed, and ſent forth, then <hi>Eſther</hi> and the godly Ones pray mightily. Thus did <hi>Jacob,</hi> when his Brother was coming to meet him, fearing he would cut off the Mother with the Child;<note place="margin">Gen. 33.</note> how did he then wreſtle with God!</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In Times of Temptation. When Chriſt was aſſaulted, and his Hour was come, he prayed hard, he ſpent a whole Night in Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.44. And what ſaith he to his Diſciples?<note place="margin">Mat. 26.40, 41. 2 Cor. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> had that <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh, the Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, he beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from him.</hi> That three times (as ſome conclude) might be threeſcore times.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Laſtly; In a Time of great Expectation, when great Things are near, and much look'd for. When <hi>Daniel</hi> expected great Things, underſtanding by Books, Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the Church was at hand, he ſet himſelf to ſeek God. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; Conſider, Prayer is a great Ordinance. And that doth appear,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In reſpect of God; it gives him the Glory of three great Attributes.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) Of his Omniſciency: We hereby acknowledg, that he knows our Wants and Neceſſities:<note place="margin">Pſal. 39 9.</note> 
                        <hi>All my Deſires are before thee, and my Groanings are not hid from thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) His Omnipotency. We acknowledg, in our crying to God, and relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in this Duty, that he is able to help us, and ſupply all our Wants.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:39531:95"/>(3.) It gives him the Glory of his Goodneſs: <hi>O thou that heareſt Prayer.</hi> A Saint knows, and confeſſeth hereby (if he pray aright) that God is willing and ready to help and ſave him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Prayer is a great Ordinance, if we conſider the Power and Prevalency of it <hi>Luther</hi> aſcribed to Prayer a kind of Omnipotency. It hath prevailed over Fire, Water, and Earth; it hath ſtopp'd the Sun in its Courſe. It hath prevailed over evil Angels it hath caſt the Devil out, and broke his Kingdom down. It hath had Power over the good Angels, as appears in the Caſe of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> it fetched them from Heaven to be his Guard and Protection, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.6, 17. Nay, it hath prevailed with Chriſt himſelf, the Angel of the Covenant, as appears in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Caſe: <hi>As a Prince, thou haſt wreſtled with God, and haſt prevailed.</hi> It hath healed the Sick, raiſed the Dead, ſtopp'd the Lion's Mouth, and hath ſubdued and put to flight the Armies of Aliens;<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> hath opened Priſon-Doors, and broke in pieces Chains, Gates, and Bars of Iron and Braſs. There is none of the battering Rams, or Artillery of Hell can ſtand againſt it. 'Tis like an Engine (as one obſerves) that makes the Perſecutors tremble; and wo to them that are the Buts and Marks that it is levell'd at, when it is fired with the Fire of the Spirit, and diſcharged in the Strength of Faith. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> dreaded more the Prayers of Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> than an Army of Twenty Thouſand Men; ſhe had more cauſe, than an Army of Ten Hundred Thouſand. 'Tis ſaid of the Witneſſes, that <hi>They have Power to ſhut Heaven,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 11 5.</note> 
                        <hi>that it rain not in the Days of their Prophecy; and have Power over Waters, to turn them into Blood, and to ſmite the Earth with Plagues, as often as they will.</hi> How do they this, but by Prayer?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Prayer is a great Ordinance, will appear, if we conſider the Promiſes made to it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22. <hi>Job</hi> 15.7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That it is a great Ordinance, will appear, if we conſider how it co-works with all other Ordinances and Duties, to make them effectual, whether Moral or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical: <hi>Every thing is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That Prayer is a great Ordinance, doth appear by the Influences it hath over all our Graces. (1.) 'Tis the Means for getting Grace; hereby a Souldier of Chriſt obtains his Armor. (2.) And for the Increaſe of Grace, in order to the acting of it. (3.) For the evidencing of Grace. It is that which brings the Soul into God's Preſence, and fills it with Divine Joy and Peace in believing.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is the Divine Breath of the Soul; can a Man live longer than he breaths? A Saint dies, when he quite ceaſeth Praying.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What hinders or obſtructs the Anſwer of the Saint's Prayer?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When we pray not according to God's Will; God's Will muſt be the Rule of our Prayers. <hi>And this is the Confidence that we have in him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.14. Jam. 4.3.</note> 
                        <hi>that if we ask any thing according to his Will, he heareth us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the End or Aim of a Man is not right: <hi>Ye ask, and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs, that ye may conſume it on your Luſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. When we pray not in Faith; Unbelief hinders the Anſwer of Prayer:<note place="margin">Jam. 1.6.</note> 
                        <hi>But let him ask in Faith, nothing wavering,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When Endeavours after the things we want, are not joined with our Prayers.<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.4.</note> As we have a Mouth to beg, we muſt have a Hand to work.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When any one Sin reſteth in the Boſom unrepented of:<note place="margin">Pſal. 66.18.</note> 
                        <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, the Lord will not hear me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When we are not fervent. Prayer muſt be with Affection unto God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When we pray not in Spirit. Our Spirits muſt pray; and not only ſo, but if the Spirit of God doth not act and aſſiſt our Spirits, our Prayers will not prevail.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. When we are not conſtant in the Duty. We muſt be importunate and conſtant,<note place="margin">Luk 18.1.</note> pray always, and not faint, if we would have our Prayers heard.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When we come not to God in the Name of Chriſt, the Door is ſhut. We muſt ask in Chriſt's Name, and come to God by him, if we would be heard and accepted by him.</p>

It is impoſſible for a Man to run this Race with the World upon his Back. What was it that weighed down the young Man in the Goſpel, that came running to Chriſt, who ſeemed to be in a full ſpeed towards eternal Life? Was it not the inordinate Love to the World? 2.

                  <p>BElievers, as well as Miniſters, are called by our Saviour the <hi>Salt of the Earth;</hi> for Chriſt preached this Sermon not only to his Apoſtles, but to all the Diſciples; it is not appropriated to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alone, but to all Believers.</p>
                  <p>Why the Godly are and may be compared to Salt, is briefly opened in the following Parallel.</p>

                           <cell>SO the Godly are moſt profitable in all the Earth. 1. They keep the World from being totally corrupted by evil and peſtilent Errors and Hereſy. (2.) From being ſpoiled by Prophaneneſs and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Debauchery. They by their holy Lives, Doctrine, and gracious Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, put a check to the over-ſpreading Wickedneſs of thoſe Places where they live. The World would ſoon grow much worſe than it is, were it not for the Saints and People of God; it would ſtink, and be ſo abominable in God's ſight, that he would not endure it any longer. And beſides, God many times ſpares a People, Family, and Nation, for the ſake of the Righteous who dwell among them. The Godly are the Intereſt of People and Nations, (as is elſewhere ſhewed.)

                           <cell>A Pilgrim is one that travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth from one Place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is far from home.</cell>
                           <cell>THe Saints of God are ſpiritual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, they are far from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe, Heaven is their everlaſting Home, and thither they are going. All the holy Patriarchs and Prophets confeſſed they were Pilgrims on the Earth. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Days of the Years of my Pilgrimage, (rather than the Days of my Life,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Gen. 47 9.</note>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Uncertainty of his Abode here, and in reſpect of his removing from Place to Place.</cell>

                        <row>
                           <cell>II. A Pilgrim that ſets out in a long Journey, takes care to free himſelf of all manner of Weights, and unneceſſary Burthens, and whatſoever elſe may tend to weary, or unfit him for his Journey.</cell>
                           <cell>II. So the ſpiritual Pilgrim, when he firſt ſets out in the Ways of God, lays aſide every Weight,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet him. It greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves him ſo to do; for one Sin carried in the Boſom, or the inordinate Love to any Thing or Perſon of this World, will prove of dreadful conſequence to him. The young Man in the Goſpel had gone a great way, ſeemed to be a very zealous Pilgrim; but he had ſuch a cruel Burthen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Shoulders, that he tired before he came to the end of his Journey. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, or an unſatisfied Deſire after the Things of this World, is compared to a Burthen, or Load of thick Clay: <hi>Who enlargeth his Deſires as Hell, and cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wo to him that encreaſeth that which is not his; how long?</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Hab. 2.5, 6</note> 
                              <hi>And to him that ladeth himſelf with thick Clay.</hi> Would not a Man that hath a long Journey to go, be laugh'd at, ſhould he carry with him a heavy Burthen of Dirt and Rubbiſh? Such Fools are many Profeſſors. <hi>See Runner.</hi>

                        <row>
                           <cell>III. A Pilgrim in his Travels goes up-hill and down-hill; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he meets with good Way, and ſometimes with bad Way: Sometimes he paſſeth over Stiles, and through dirty Lanes; and then again through green Fields and pleaſant Paſtures, and delightful Paths, till he comes to his deſired Place.</cell>
                           <cell>III. So the Pilgrim that would travel to the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> meets with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ways and Paſſages. 1. He muſt go out of the horrible Pit of Prophaneneſs; that is Work enough for the firſt Day's Journey. 2. Through the Brook of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance, or true Contrition, (for every one that leaves open Prophaneneſs, is not truly penitent.) 3. Down the Valley of Self-denial, a very difficult Paſſage. 4. Over the Mountains of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for the Devil and all will ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way make head againſt him. 5. Over the Stile of carnal Reaſon: <hi>Immediatly I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted not with Fleſh and Blood.</hi> 6. Into the pleaſant Ways of the New Covenant. 7. So upon the Top of the Rock of Ages, and there he may take a Proſpect of his own Country.</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                           <cell>IV. A Pilgrim, that hath a long and difficult Way to travel, is very thoughtful how to find the right Way, being a Stranger in that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:39531:100"/> Country through which he muſt paſs. And beſides, being told there are many croſs Ways and Turnings, and hard difficult Paſſages to find, he takes care therefore to get a good and skilful Guide, leſt he ſhould loſe his Way.</cell>
                           <cell>IV. So the ſpiritual Pilgrim ſpares no Coſt, omits no Study, to get the beſt Information imaginable, of the ready Way to the Land of Promiſe. He cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to enquire of ſuch as pretend
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:39531:100"/> themſelves to be Guides, and ſuch as know the Way; but finding them to be ſhort-fighted, and ignorant of the Way themſelves, he ſeeks further. And as he goes along, one cries, This is the Way,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.23</note> another, That. Some bid him believe as the Church believes, and he ſhall never go aſtray. Others bid him co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>form to the Laws of Men, and do whatever the Supreme Authority of the Nation doth enjoin in Matters of Faith and Religion. Others call upon him to be led wholly by the Light of his Conſcience, and that will bring him unto the Land of Promiſe, the Place he longs for. And at laſt he meets with another, that ſeems yet to differ from them all, and greatly to ſlight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn one grand Fundamental God's Word holds forth, under plauſible Pretences. He cries up Holineſs, and juſt Living, which all confeſs is required; but in the mean time ſtrives to perſuade him to caſt off the Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, and truſt to his own Righteouſneſs, or to refined Morality, rendring Faith in Chriſt crucified little more than a Fancy; and that the main Deſign of Chriſt in coming into the World was, only to be a Pattern of Holineſs and Humility. But he perceiving the Danger great upon this account, and that none of theſe Pretenders could give any convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Evidence why they ſhould be believed, and their Counſel followed, above others, he rejected all their Directions, and reſolved to be led by none of them, further than their Doctrine agreed with a certain Directory, which through the Grace of God he hath obtained, namely, the written Word of God; and that tells him plainly, <hi>The Way is Chriſt, viz.</hi> Chriſt, as a Prieſt, dying for him, to appeaſe the Wrath of God,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.6.</note> and make Atonement for his Sin, fulfilling the Law, and bringing in everlaſting Righteouſneſs. Chriſt, as a King, to ſubdue his Sin, and to rule and reign over him,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note> according to thoſe bleſſed and wholeſom Laws, Ordinances, and Inſtitutions, given forth by him, and left in his Word. Chriſt, as a Prophet, to teach and inſtruct him. Chriſt, as a holy Pattern and Example, to imitate and follow, ſo far as by the help of Grace he is able. [See <hi>Surety, Sin a Debt, The Word compared to Light, The Spirit to a Teacher and Guide.</hi>] He hath learned of Chriſt to be holy, and is helped therein by the Holy-Ghoſt to excell his Neighbour, and denies all his Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſts; and yet caſts himſelf only on Chriſt, relying upon his Merits, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to be like him in all things, as the Apoſtle obſerves:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.3.</note> 
                              <hi>He that hath this Hope in him, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi> He lets his Sins go, nay, loaths that which is evil; he lives a mortified Life unto the World, and yet truſteth not to any thing that he hath done, or can do, for eternal Life,<note place="margin">Acts 4.12.</note> knowing there is no Salvation but by Chriſt alone. He is as godly as any <hi>Socinian</hi> in the World, and yet magnifies the Riches of God's Grace, and Chriſt's Merits, ſo as not to expect Juſtification any other way.</cell>

                           <cell>V. A Pilgrim often meets with Trouble, and great Difficulties in his Way, by Winds, Storms, and Tempeſts, hard Weather, Cold, Froſt and Snow, deep and bad Ways, and many Dangers, which he narrowly eſcapes.</cell>
                           <cell>V. So the ſpiritual Pilgrim is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to many Difficulties in his Journey Heaven-wards. Terrible Storms ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſe, Winds of Perſecution and Temptation blow ſo hard, that he is ſcarce able to ſtand upon his Legs.<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.2.</note> 
                              <hi>My Feet were almoſt gone, my Steps had well nigh ſlipt,</hi> &amp;c. He is often beſet with Croſſes and Afflictions, that he is as a Man in the Mire, and can hardly get out.</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                           <cell>VI. A Pilgrim is a Stranger in the Country through which he paſſeth; and being not known, he is much gazed on, and ſometimes abuſed by the rude Rabble; all which he takes with patience, and makes no reſiſtance.</cell>
                           <cell>VI. So the Godly are Strangers in this World: — <hi>And confeſſed,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 11.13</note> 
                              <hi>that they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth.</hi> David breaks forth, <hi>Hold not thy peace at my Tears,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.12</note> 
                              <hi>for I am a Stranger with thee, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer, as all my Fathers were.</hi> Hence they are made oftentimes a Gazing-ſtock to Men, by Reproaches and Afflictions.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.33.</note>
                              <pb n="172" facs="tcp:39531:101"/> And how grievouſly have they been abuſed by the wicked Rabble of the Earth, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf teſtifieth: <hi>If ye were of the World, the World would love its own;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Joh. 15.19, 22.</note> 
                              <hi>but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you. All theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe they know not him that ſent me.</hi>

                        <row>
                           <cell>VII. A Pilgrim is a Man that ſtayeth not long in a Place where he comes; he is but a Sojourner for a Night, and is gone; his Heart is upon his Journey.</cell>
                           <cell>VII. So the Saints of God have here no continuing City, but ſeek one to come.<note place="margin">Heb 13 14</note> This is not their Reſt; their Abode is here but as in a ſtrange Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go forth on their ſpiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs towards that City,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.9, 10.</note> that hath Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, <hi>whoſe Builder and Maker is God.</hi>
                           </cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                           <cell>VIII. A Pilgrim is not always in the ſame good Diſpoſition of Body and Mind, fit and neceſſary for his Journey, but ſometimes may be diſtempered, or grow dull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and out of Heart, upon the account of the great Difficulties that attend him, which when he is delivered and eaſed of, it much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth his Heart.</cell>
                           <cell>VIII. So a Saint is often attended with ſpiritual Diſtempers; his Heart is out of Frame, and in a very unfit Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for any Duty; the Troubles and Incumbrances of this Life dull and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his ſervent Deſires after God, and make him go on heavily, nay, ready to tire him, and cauſe him to faint in his Mind: yet by the help of the Spirit, and ſerious Meditations of the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Country to which he is travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he is ſoon quickned again, and gets freſh Strength and Reſolution. He expoſtulateth the Caſe with himſelf after this manner: Shall wicked Men purſue after the Vanities of this World with ſuch Pains and Unweariedneſs! and ſhall I be ready to faint, that have Aſſurance of a Crown of Glory at the end of my Journey! O how diſproportionable are their Labours to their Gains! Bluſh, O my Soul, at thy own Neglects! and be aſtoniſhed, either at their Diligence, or at thy own Sloth! Do they labour in the Fire for very Vanity? and wilt thou ſhew ſuch a ſottiſh, dead, and unbelieving Frame of Heart, as not to purſue with more Zeal and Diligence after that glorious Country, and endleſs Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city before thee? Is not Heaven worth ſtriving for, and travelling to?</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                           <cell>IX. A Pilgrim is glad when he meets with good Company in the Way, eſpecially other Pilgrims, ſuch as are travelling to the ſame Place to which he is going himſelf. What is more deſirable to a Traveller, than a faithful Friend and Companion? <q>This makes (ſaith one) evil things little, and good things great; by this ſweet Society our Griefs are divided, and all our Joys are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. What Calamity is not into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, without a Friend, (a Companion)? And what Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not ungrateful, if we have none to ſhare with us in it? We ſuffer not ſo much, when we have ſome to condole and ſuffer with us; and we rejoyce the more, when our Felicity gives a pleaſure not only to our ſelves, but to others alſo. If Solitude, and Want of Company, be ſo horrid, ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39531:101"/> a thing, it is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Want of Men, but of the Want of Friends, (meet Company) for it is a good Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, not to dwell with thoſe that do not love us; and a Man would chuſe ſuch a Hermitage, where he might not be troubled with them who bear no benevolous Affection to him. But for my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that Man to be happy, which hath no Friend to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in his Pleaſures. A Man may more eaſily bear the hardeſt Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with his Friend, than the greateſt Felicity alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </cell>
                           <cell>IX. So a Saint, or ſpiritual Pilgrim, is glad when he meets with good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Companions in his Journey to the Land of Promiſe. <hi>They that fear thee,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.74.</note> 
                              <hi>will be glad when they ſee me, becauſe I have hoped in thy Word. I am a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts.</hi> What ſweet Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip have God's Children one with another! How much doth their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Converſe and Communion refreſh and chear each others Hearts, under all their Sufferings and Hardſhips, which they meet with in their ſpiritual Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage? <hi>We took ſweet Counſel together,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Pſal. 55.4.</note> 
                              <hi>and walked unto the Houſe of God in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi> If earthly Society be ſo deſirable, how pleaſant is the Society of Saints, or Communion with thoſe we ſhall dwell with for ever! Chriſtian Pilgrims have great Advantage in their Journey, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling together. If the one be poor, and the other rich, the one relieves his Fellow; or if the one be weak, and the other ſtrong, the one can take the other by the hand, and afford ſome help to him, when they meet with bad Way, or go
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39531:101"/> up-hill.<note place="margin">Eccleſ 4.9, 10.</note> 
                              <hi>Two</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) are better than one; for if they fall, the one will help up his Fellow.</hi> Moſt Travellers have found by Experience, how comfortable it is to have good Company in a long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. They very much ſtrengthen and encourage each other, and by this means the Way ſeems not ſo long and tedious, as otherwiſe it would. They will, if one be ſad or caſt down, enquire what the matter is, and often ask how each other do; and thus it is with Believers. <hi>Paul</hi>'s great care was, to know the State of the Saints to whom he wrote, and with whom he converſed.</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                           <cell>X. A Pilgrim ſometimes meets with Enemies, ſuch as ſtrive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to go back, telling him, the Danger would be great, and the Difficulty ſuch, that the Advantage he expects at the end of his Journey to receive, would not make a Recompence for his Pains and Labour.</cell>
                           <cell>
                              <p>X. So a ſpiritual Pilgrim meets with divers Enemies in his Journey towards Heaven, who ſtrive to diſcourage him, and turn him back,<note place="margin">Num. 6.14</note> like as the evil Spies ſerved the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Time would fail me to tell you all their Names, nevertheleſs I ſhall diſcover ſome of theſe Enemies to you, that ſo you who are bound for the holy Land, may avoid the pernicious Counſel they frequently give, and be ſtrengthned againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements they lay in the way of true Piety.</p>
                              <p>1. The firſt is <hi>Fear.</hi> This is a very dangerous Enemy; he ſaith, there is a Lion in the Way, a Lion in the Streets, and many other evil Beaſts, who will devour him, and tear him in pieces, if he proceed on in his intended Journey. <hi>There we ſaw the Sons of</hi> Anak, <hi>the Sons of the Giants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>2. The ſecond is <hi>
                                    <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief: I ſhall now one day periſh by the Hands of</hi> Saul.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 27.1</note> This Adverſary ſuggeſteth to the Soul, That it is doubtful whether there is any ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Land, or heavenly Country that he talks of, or no: or if there be, yet (ſaith he) it is not poſſible for you to find it; and that certainly you will fall ſhort of it, and faint, before you come to the end of your Journey; your Sins, ſaith he, are ſo great, that God will not forgive them.</p>
                              <p>3. The third is <hi>Sloth,</hi> a lazy Companion, that would have him ſleep and ſlumber away his precious Time, and not trouble his Head with Religion, but pleaſe his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Appetite, telling him, that Heaven may be had with good Wiſhes, and formal Prayer, by crying, <hi>Lord, have mercy upon us,</hi> and, <hi>Chriſt, have mercy upon us,</hi> &amp;c. And if he have but Time, a little before he breaths out his laſt, on a Death-Bed, but to cry unto God after this manner, it will be ſufficient. Tho God's Word ſaith, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> And, <hi>Except a Man be born again,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Ezek 18. Joh. 3.3. Heb. 12.</note> 
                                 <hi>he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And, <hi>Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> It is only a holy Life, that is attended with a happy Death.</p>

What! ſaith he, art thou ſuch a Fool, to expoſe thy ſelf to ſuch great Sorrow and Suffering for Heaven, when thou mayeſt have it without half the Ado. Pity thy Wife and Children, ſave thy ſelf out of a Priſon, and hazard not thy Eſtate: For my part, I came into the World raw, and I will not go out roaſted; I will be of that Religion that is in faſhion, and ſet up by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Law of the Nation. Are you wiſer than every Body? You meddle with Things too high for you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, Whoſoever comes after me,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.24, 25.</note> and doth not deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, cannot be my Diſciple; and that his Saints in the World ſhall have Tribulation. But this Man would fain make the Croſs of Chriſt to ceaſe. Come Popery, and what will, by this Argument he muſt and will conform to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:39531:102"/> it; he will be of that Religion that is uppermoſt. And thus he renders the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, and all the holy Martyrs, Fools and Fanaticks, nay, worſe, Rebels, becauſe they did not conform to the Religion of their Superiors.</p>

He ſaith, It is ſufficient, and no more is required of us, but to do as we would be done unto, and pay every Man his own: and that if a Man can but get out of the deep Ditch of Senſuality, and fleſhly Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and lead a ſpotleſs Life towards Man, he need not doubt of Heaven, nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf about Faith in Chriſt, and Regeneration.

Tho I am a Sinner, and am now and then drunk, and let flie an Oath ſometimes before I am aware, yet I doubt not but it will go well with me; my Heart is good, and Chriſt died for ſuch as I am. This Man ſins becauſe Grace hath abounded, and forgets that Chriſt came to ſave Men from their Sins, and not in their Sins; and that that Faith that juſtifies,<note place="margin">Acts 15.9. 1 Joh. 3.3.</note> is attended with good Fruits, and purifieth the Heart and Life of him that obtains it.</p>
                              <p>7. The ſeventh Enemy is <hi>Vain-Glory.</hi> If Satan cannot enſnare the Soul by any of the other Ways, he ſtrives to puff it up with Pride and Self-conceit. Now Vain-Glory is a deadly Enemy, therefore take heed of him. It becomes Chriſtians to be lowly-minded: <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for I am meek and lowly in Heart;</hi>

They reſolved to keep them down, they ſtrove to hinder their Growth, they deſigned to ſpoil their Multiplying, and their Growth in Number, as alſo in Grace and Vertue; but they were like the Palm-Tree, the more they were oppreſſed, the more they grew and multiplied. That way Men think to hinder the Truth, to obſtruct the Goſpel from flouriſhing; that way God takes to make it ſpread and flouriſh the more. Thoſe things that happened to the Apoſtles, to hinder their Miniſtry, God made for the furtherance of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This ſhould raiſe up our Hearts to magnify the Power, Wiſdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, who over-rules things thus in the World; who turns that for Good, which wicked Men deſign for the great Hurt of his poor People. <hi>This alſo cometh from the Lord of Hoſts, who is wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in Working.</hi> He makes the Righteous to flouriſh like the Palm-Tree, to grow upwards, by thoſe Ways and Means which one would think would bring them quite down, and utterly ſpoil their growing. <q>Like as when we ſee the Corn laid at, and threſh'd with a Flail,<note place="margin">Caryl.</note> one would think there were great Hurt intended to the Corn, but it is only to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it from the Straw and Chaff, that it may appear in its own Beauty and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: So the Lord hath his Flail, to ſeparate the Chaff from the Wheat. Thoſe Acts of Providence, which ſeem to be for their Hurt and Undoing, when they are threſh'd as it were by the World, are only to make them appear what they are. But thus it fareth not with the Wicked, who flouriſh not like the Palm-Tree, but as the Graſs they paſs away.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This may animate the Righteous, and greatly encourage them againſt Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why ſhould they fear that which God turns to their great Advantage? O let us labour to improve Burthens, Afflictions, and heavy Preſſures, to the end God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns them, and never more fear the worſt that Men can do unto us. <hi>The Righteous ſhall flouriſh like the Palm-Tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Let us labour for Union, and ſtrengthen one another, combine as one Man in the Way of Holineſs and Chriſtian Affection, that ſo thereby we may, like the tender Plants of the Palm-Tree, get Strength, and ſtand when the Wind blows har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and the Storms of the Ungodly riſe upon us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This may be alſo Matter of Trial to us; we hereby may try our ſelves, and try our Graces. How is it with you (Sirs) under Sufferings? Do you grow and flouriſh the more? If you wither and decay in Grace, in a Day of Trial, or when you are under Preſſures and Afflictions, and cannot bear hard Things for Chriſt's ſake, it clearly ſhews you are none of God's Palm-Trees.</p>

If they comply with Satan, and yield to Temptations, and thereby let their Light go out, no wonder if the World ſtumble. Sometimes Profeſſors, inſtead of being Lights, prove dark Stumbling-Blocks.

                     <p>Therefore if you want Motives to ſtir you up to take heed how you walk and live among Men, that you may not give occaſion of Offence or Stumbling to them, but contrary-wiſe, be as Lights to them, take theſe following,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Your good Works, and holy Converſation, will greatly tend to glorify God; but the contrary will greatly diſhonour him.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. An evil Life hinders poor Souls from enquiring after the Truth, and ſtumbles them in the way of their Obedience to it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It ſtumbles weak Chriſtians that are in the Ways of God.</p>

                              <p>1. By their ſpeaking for it when others ſpeak againſt it. God's Truth, his Way, and People are commonly derided, and ſpoke againſt; and he that is a ſincere and valiant Chriſtian, will, at all times when he ſees there is need for it, vindicate it, and ſpeak in the behalf thereof.</p>
                              <p>2. In their endeavouring to clear it from Reproach and Infamy. The Way or Truth of God is frequently reproached. 1. 'Tis called Error and Hereſy:<note place="margin">Acts 24.14. Acts 24.5. Acts 17.19.</note> 
                                 <hi>After that way you call Hereſy, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. 2. 'Tis called Sedition. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> was accuſed for being a <hi>Mover of Sedition.</hi> 3. 'Tis commonly called a new Doctrine: <hi>We would know what this new Doctrine whereof thou ſpeakeſt is.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>3. They ſhew their Courage in contending earneſtly for the Truth; they will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and argue out the Matter in behalf of Truth, and not give up the Juſtneſs and Goodneſs of their Cauſe, as long as they are able to ſtand by it, or by force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to maintain it. <hi>Paul</hi> upon this account ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.32.</note> he <hi>fought with Beaſts at</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>i. e.</hi> Men like Beaſts, who acted like Beaſts in oppoſing the Truth.</p>
                              <p>4. In their viſible profeſſing and publick owning of the Truth. They are not afraid nor aſhamed to confeſs Chriſt and his Ways before Men. Some for fear of the Jews did not publickly own Jeſus Chriſt in the Days of his Fleſh; but ſuch who are ſincere will go forth, bearing his Reproach. Tho Men forbid them,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.13.</note> nay threaten them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they will preach Jeſus Chriſt, and profeſs his Name, and maintain his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:39531:109"/> Ordinances, and bleſſed Inſtitutions. The Apoſtles cried out,<note place="margin">Acts 4 20. &amp; 5.29.</note> 
                                 <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the Things which we have ſeen and heard,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. They ſhew their Courage in ſuffering for the Truth, when called ſo to do. (1.) They will ſuffer Reproach for the Truth. (2.) They will ſuffer Blows for the Truth. (3.) Impriſonment for the Truth. (4.) Loſs of their Goods. (5.) Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. (6.) Yea, Death it ſelf, when called to it, rather than deny Chriſt, and the Truth.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. They will ſtand by the Truth, when others turn their Backs upon it. Thus did <hi>Paul.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="7">7. They will maintain every Truth, but more eſpecially that Truth which is moſt oppoſed in the Day in which they live. It may be no demonſtration of Courage, to ſtand up for, or maintain a Truth in one Age, which was a great Proof of Valour in another, when it was chiefly oppoſed. Would it be any Sign of ſpiritual Courage now, to affirm God is God, and <hi>Baal</hi> is not? yet that was in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Days.<note place="margin">1 Kings 18</note> Or would it be any Demonſtration of Courage now, to affirm Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the true Saviour? yet it was in the Apoſtle's Time, becauſe it was the great Truth then oppoſed. Chriſtian Courage is now ſhewed, by owning and maintaining thoſe Truths of Chriſt now oppoſed, and which in ſtanding by, do expoſe the Profeſſors thereof.</p>
                              <p>Now that which doth animate and embolden the Saints in the Day of Trial, in ſtanding up for Chriſt, and his Ways, is:</p>
                              <p n="1">1. The Satisfaction they have touching the Truth of that which they profeſs. 'Tis God's Truth.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The Conſideration of the Excellency of God's Truth:<note place="margin">Pſal 119.</note> 
                                 <hi>The Word of God is pure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. The Conſideration of the Goodneſs and Juſtneſs of their Call to ſuffer in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Truth; for that is one thing which muſt always be conſidered.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. The Goodneſs of their Conſciences, or the Evidences of their own Sincerity. A Hypocrite may ſuffer ſome things, but at laſt his Courage will fail him. I have heard of a Captain, that principally would make choice of two Sorts of Men for his Souldiers, <hi>viz.</hi> either ſincere and godly Chriſtians, or downright Atheiſts, becauſe neither of them (he concluded) would be afraid to die: The true Chriſtian would not be afraid of Death, becauſe he knew he ſhould go to Chriſt; and the Atheiſt would not be afraid of Death, becauſe he thought, or rather hoped he ſhould die as a Beaſt, and there would be an end of him.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. The Conſideration of his having ſo good a Second. A couragious and undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Second oftentimes puts much Courage into a Perſon that is ſingled out to fight a Duel. Now a Chriſtian has the Almighty and Terrible God to take his part, <hi>&amp;c. Fear not, Worm</hi> Jacob, <hi>I will help thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Iſa. 41.14. Heb. 13.5, 6.</note> So that we may boldly ſay, <hi>The Lord is my Helper, I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="6">6. The Certainty of getting the Victory, or overcoming at laſt. As it is ſaid of <hi>Gad,</hi> it may be ſaid of a Chriſtian, tho a Troop may overcome him, yet he ſhall overcome at laſt. Hence Saints are ſaid to be more than Conquerors;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.37</note> for no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror is certain, whilſt he is in the Conflict, that he ſhall at laſt obtain the Conqueſt.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. The Conſideration of that exceeding great Reward, which they ſhall receive when they have overcome, wonderfully adds Courage and Boldneſs unto them. <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi>

                  <p n="1">I. A Heart of Fleſh is a tender thing; every ſmall Prick will make it bleed: So every Sin, nay, the ſmalleſt Sin will offend, and make a tender-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cry out, much more a great Sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. A Heart of Fleſh is a ſoft Heart; the Philoſophers Deſcription of a ſoft thing is, that it eaſily gives way to a Touch: So a true Chriſtian, a tender-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will yield to God's Word, to his Reproofs, to his Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lay your Finger upon a Stone, and that yields not; but lay your Finger upon Fleſh, and that will yield:<note place="margin">2 King. 22.19.</note> So will a Saint. <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s Heart melted, when the Law of God was read to him; his Heart gave way and yielded to God's Word, and trembled at the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced; he had a Heart of Fleſh, a tender and ſoft Heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. A Heart of Fleſh cannot bear a great Weight, a heavy Burden will cruſh and mar it exceedingly. Lay never ſo great a Weight upon a Stone, and that will bear it; you cannot cruſh that, nor make the leaſt Impreſſion in it, what Weight ſoever you lay upon it: but a Heart of Fleſh, or that which is of a ſoft Subſtance, is of another Nature; a Weight will bruiſe, cruſh, and mar it immediatly. So a tender-hearted Chriſtian cannot bear the Weight of Sin; he feels the Burthen ſo heavy, that he is ſorely cruſhed down and oppreſſed under the Guilt thereof, and grievouſly bruiſed. Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>I am ſore broken, I am bowed down greatly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. A Heart of Fleſh, I mean a living Heart, (for 'tis ſuch a one of which the Text ſpeaks) is a ſenſible Heart: So a tender-hearted Chriſtian, or a Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath a Heart of Fleſh, is very ſenſible. Such are ſenſible of their own Vileneſs, and loath themſelves before the Lord, cannot bear the Thoughts of God's Diſpleaſure; it goes to their very Heart, to think that the holy and infinite God ſhould be diſpleaſed and offended with them: they are ſenſible of their own Sorrows, and of the Sorrows and Miſeries of others. A tender-hearted Perſon will grieve for the Afflictions of his Brethren and Siſters; if his Mother, or any dear Relation, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and in great Miſery, O how ſenſible is he of it, and how ſorely troubled and diſquieted in his Spirit! And thus it is with a tender hearted Saint, O how is he grieved for the diſtreſſed Saints, and for diſtreſſed <hi>Sion!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. A Heart of Fleſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> a tender Heart, will take any Impreſſion you pleaſe: So a tender-hearted Chriſtian will take any Impreſſion from God: He is like Wax melted, that will take the Impreſſion of the Seal. They are ready to take the Stamp of the Word, the Image of God, which is Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. The Spirit and Word of God can mould theſe Hearts into any Form or Faſhion God pleaſeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="1">I. A Steward is a Perſon that hath Goods or Moneys committed to his Charge: So every Chriſtian hath many Goods, called Talents, committed to him,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.14, 15.</note> both Spirituals and Temporals.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A Steward cannot ſay, the Riches which are committed to him are his own; no, he is but the Steward of them, in Truſt, they being the proper Right of another Man, or his Lord's Goods: So a Chriſtian cannot ſay, any thing he hath is his own; all he is and hath is the Lord's.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. A Steward ought to diſpoſe of every thing committed to his Charge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſpecial Command of his Maſter, who poſſibly orders him to pay ſo much to ſuch an one, and ſo much to ſuch an one, and ſo much to ſuch Poor that dwell in the Pariſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So every Chriſtian ought to diſpoſe of all his Lord's Goods, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his expreſs Command laid down in his Word, or he is no faithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. So much he is required to diſpoſe of to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that may tend to make their Lives comfortable, and free them from the perplexing Cares of this Life, which greatly hinder them in their Miniſtry. The true Miniſter's Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is <hi>jure divino,</hi> of divine Right: <hi>So hath the Lord ordained,</hi>

                        <hi>that they that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> Alſo they are required to give to the Poor, that they may not want, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Charity ought to be according to their Ability, and the Poor's Neceſſity; and not only to give, but to give cheerfully, with a willing Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Stewards are required to improve their Lord's Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Chriſtians ought to improve all thoſe ſpiritual Gifts and Graces, Time and Strength, Wiſdom and Knowledg. Whatſoever God hath given to them, he expects they ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to his Glory, and to the Profit of their Neighbours.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. 'Tis a great and horrible Evil in a Steward, to mind his own Buſineſs and Concerns more than the Concerns of his Lord and Maſter: So 'tis an utter Fault, (and that which may juſtly call in queſtion the Truth of his Sincerity and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) for a Chriſtian to mind the World, and his own private Intereſt, more than the Intereſts and Concerns of Jeſus Chriſt. Some care not what becomes of Chriſt's Labourers, or of the poor Saints, nor of the Intereſt of the Goſpel, ſo that they have all things to their Hearts Content. They eat the Fat, and drink the Sweet, and lay up great Store of Treaſure for their own Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have (perhaps) their Hundreds and Thouſands by them; and in the mean while many faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters hard put to it to get Bread. Is it not an abominable Evil in a Steward, to live like a Lord himſelf upon his Maſter's Goods, and let his Maſter's Children want Bread; and alſo to keep back the Right of his faithful and painful Labourers, for whoſe ſake he intruſted him with ſo much Subſtance?</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. A Steward muſt expect to be called to an Account: <hi>Give an Account of thy Stewardſhip,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p n="5">5. Let us enquire, whether we are God's Jewels, or not. (1.) Are we regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ones? have we the Pearl of Faith, Love, Humility? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.) Are we holy, ſincere and faithful in all things to God? (3.) Do we excell others? Is there a real, or only a ſeeming Worth and Excellency in us? What do we more than others? (4.) Do we grow in Grace? doth the Work of God go on upon our Hearts? Are we more ſit for Heaven to day, than we were yeſterday? A Jewel in the hand of a Jeweller is every day nearer finiſhing. <hi>The Righteous ſhall hold on his Way, and he that hath clean hands ſhall grow ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi>

                     <p n="1">I. KIngs are uſually highly deſcended, or are Sons of Nobles: So the Saints are all highly deſcended, they are born from above, born of God, and ſo may be ſaid to be the Off-ſpring of Heaven: <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God!

                     <p n="7">VII.

Alas! it would be ſo indeed, were it to die the common Death of all Men. Death puts an end to all the external Miſeries of Mortals: but the Death of Sin's Captives is quite another thing: They are condemned to be burned, to be burned alive too; but this is not all, to lie burning in the Fire of God's eternal Wrath for ever, where they ſhall be always dying, but cannot die: <hi>Where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> God forbid! There is good News for theſe Slaves and Captives of Sin and the Devil, a Goſpel to be preached to them; God is full of Bowels; were there no Deliverance to relieve, it would be ſad beyond what any are able to conceive. But to prove that there is Salvation and Relief for the vileſt Sinners, conſider theſe three things following.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Lord Jeſus hath purchaſed Deliverance for them, he hath laid down a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Price or Ranſom for thoſe Captives, who through Faith in him ſhall obtain Deliverance.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Chriſt is ordained and anointed to preach glad Tidings to them.<note place="margin">Luk. 4.18. Iſa. 61.1.</note> 
                           <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the Poor: He hath ſent me to heal the Broken-hearted, to preach Deliverance to the Captives, and recovering Sight to the Blind, and to ſet at Liberty them that were bound.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Many who have been in the like State of Captivity and Bondage have been ſet at Liberty; Thouſands that have been Slaves of Sin and Satan, through the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy of God are now in a perfect State of Freedom. <hi>Such were ſome of you,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sirs, what bleſſed News is this for poor Sinners! Suppoſe a Man who is a Slave or Captive, and ſuffereth juſtly for his Sin, were ſtript naked, and put into a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, bound with cruel and heavy Chains, wounded in a moſt fearful manner from Head to Foot, and only fed with Aſhes and Gravel-ſtones, and in this Condition were condemned to abide for many Years, and then to be put to the greateſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that Mortals can deviſe, where he ſhould ſuffer a long Time together, always dying, and yet cannot die; and that on a ſudden one ſhould come to him with the joyful News of a full and perfect Deliverance; would not this be the welcomeſt News that ever he heard? Sinners, may not the Tidings you hear, cauſe your Hearts to leap in you for Joy! Tho you have undone your ſelves by your wicked Works, yet God hath deviſed a way to deliver and ſave you for ever.</p>
                        <p>Queſt. <hi>How, by what means, and by whom</hi> (may ſome poor ignorant Soul ſay) <hi>is Deliverance brought about?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Deliverance out of this Bondage-State is by Jeſus Chriſt, only by him, neither is there Salvation by any other. <hi>If the Son therefore make you free,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>This Conqueſt by the Lord Jeſus is twofold:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For us without us: <hi>When he aſcended on high, he led Captivity captive.</hi> He took him captive,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.8. Col. 2.15.</note> that had taken Mankind captive. <hi>Having ſpoiled Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he made a Shew of them openly,</hi> (the Work is already done) <hi>triumphing over them in it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. This Conqueſt is wrought by Chriſt alſo in the Soul; for palpable it is, that every unconverted Perſon is under the Power of theſe cruel Enemies, (as hath been already ſhewn) and have they a ſufficient Power of their own to encounter with them? Is ſinful, weak, and depraved Man, a Match for Satan? Is he able to ſubdue and overcome him? Or can he by any inherent Power of his own deſtroy the Power of Sin, and change his own Heart? <hi>Can the</hi> Aethiopian <hi>change his Skin, or the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his Spots?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iſa. 13.23.</note> Is Man able to raiſe himſelf from the Power of the Grave? Any of theſe things are too hard for Sinners to do; and therefore it follows, Chriſt muſt conquer theſe Enemies in us, he muſt break our Bonds, and burſt our Chains in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pray remember, Chriſt is a perfect and compleat Saviour, he alone doth the Work,<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.5.</note> he doth it for us, and alſo in us; <hi>His own Arm brought Salvation;</hi> He hath no Partner nor Competitor.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly;</hi> As this may ſerve to humble Mankind, ſo alſo it may lift up their Hearts who are redeemed,<note place="margin">Job 7.17.</note> in Praiſes to the Almighty. O what is Man that God ſhould be mindful of him! What! regard ſuch a deplorable Rebel, Slave, and Captive of Sin and the Devil! And the rather, conſidering the Nature of that glorious Freedom procured by Jeſus Chriſt, which is, 1. A Freedom from the Guilt of Sin. 2. A Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the Filth of Sin. 3. A Freedom from the Power of Sin: <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 6.14</note> 4. A Freedom from the eternal Puniſhment of Sin; a Freedom from Sin, from Satan, from the Law, from Death, and from Wrath; and by this means made the Sons and Daughters of God, making them nigh to him, enjoying Union and Communion both with the Father and the Son, having Peace, and good Aſſurance of eternal Life.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly;</hi> It may cauſe the redeemed Ones of God to pity Sinners, pity their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Relations; what a deplorable Condition are they in! How exceedingly are Perſons concerned for their Relations who are in Slavery, tho it extend but to the Body? and what Ways and Means do they with all diligence make uſe of, to procure their Liberty and Freedom! And by how much the Bondage of Sin and Satan exceeds all the Slavery that Man can poſſibly be expoſed unto; by ſo much the more ought that Means to be improved, that may effectually accompliſh their Redemption.</p>

So the Sinner, or ſpiritual Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, neglects his Soul, and the Souls of his Family: tho he provides for the Body, and takes care what he and his ſhall have to eat, and what to put on; yet his Soul, and the Souls of ſuch as are about him, are neglected; nothing but Weeds and Corruption grow there; Sin and filthy Luſt predominate, Pride, Paſſion,<note place="margin">Jam. 3.16.</note> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and every evil Work.</cell>

                              <cell>V. The Way of the Sluggard ſeems to be barr'd or hedg'd up, that he cannot go on, he cannot find the Path.<note place="margin">Prov. 15.19.</note> 
                                 <hi>The Way of the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man is a Hedg of Thorns; but the Way of the Righteous is plain.</hi>

                              <cell>V. So the Sinner's Way, is as it were, hedged up: For like as a Hedg obſtructs or hinders a Man ſometimes in his Way, that he cannot paſs along; ſo the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by one Temptation, Obſtruction, or another, are hindred from going on in the Ways of God. Perhaps the Snares that attend their Trade, are as a Hedg to them; or the Fear of diſpleaſing a Father, or Uncle, or ſome other Relation, leſt they ſhould be left out of their Will, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of an Eſtate; or a Landlord, or ſome great Man or Neighbour, by whom they may poſſibly have their Livelihood, may be as a Hedg or Bar to obſtruct them in their following of Chriſt; and by this means is the ſpiritual Sluggard diſcouraged.</cell>

                              <cell>VI. The Sluggard doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Good that is in his hand: <hi>The ſlothful Man roaſteth not that which he took in hunting;</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Prov. 12.27.</note> that is, when he hath got Food, he doth not prepare it, nor make it meet to be received, nor feed upon it.</cell>
                              <cell>VI. So the ſpiritual Sluggard doth not enjoy the heavenly good Things that ſeem to be in his hand:<note place="margin">Prov. 17.16</note> 
                                 <hi>Wherefore is there a Price in the hand of a Fool to get Wiſdom, ſeeing he hath no Heart to it?</hi> Some Men hunt (as it were) after Knowledg; go from one Place to another, will hear this worthy Miniſter, and that worthy Miniſter, and at laſt when they have found the Veniſon, (I mean, come to underſtand the Will of God) they do not ſubject to it: they know what the Threatning is, but fear it not; and know what the Precept is, but obey it not; and know what the Promiſe is, and yet believe and apply it not. And thus they roaſt not that which they have taken in hunting; they feed not upon the Word; they are <hi>forgetful Hearers, and not Doers of the Word,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Jam 1.22.</note> and thereby deceive their own Souls.</cell>

                              <cell>VII. The Sluggard is one that loves not to encounter with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; he cannot abide to think of enduring a little Hardſhip. <hi>The Sluggard will not plow by reaſon of the Cold.</hi>

                              <cell>VII. The Spiritual Sluggard loves his Eaſe. If Religion cannot be owned, profeſſed, and ſtuck to, unleſs a Man offer ſome Force (as it were) unto himſelf, and expoſe the Fleſh to ſome Hardſhips, he preſently grows weary of it. He cannot in the Morning go to Prayer, becauſe his worldly Buſineſs calls for him, or perhaps 'tis cold, or he is indiſpoſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And perhaps he cannot pray at Night, becauſe it doth not agree with the Fleſh; the Body is weary, and would fain go to Bed. And he cannot go to Church to hear the Word of God, becauſe the Wind blows, or it rains; or he hath wearied himſelf the day before, and ſo cannot riſe early enough; or it is a great Way, and the Ways are bad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet he knows in his Conſcience, that if there were but a good Bargain to be bought, or ſome worldly Advantage to be had, tho it were not above the Value of half Five Pound, all theſe Obſtructions would be nothing. But perhaps ſome Sluggards may get over theſe things; and yet if there lie other Difficulties in the Way, they cannot hold the Plough of the Goſpel; if there is a Blaſt of Perſecution feared, he knows not how to encounter with that. And thus the Sluggard diſcourages himſelf.</cell>

                              <cell>VIII. The Sluggard, tho he is ſo ſlothful, as to hide his hand in his Boſom, and is grieved to bring it again to his Mouth, yet he is wiſe in his own Eyes.<note place="margin">Prov. 26.16.</note>

                              <cell>VIII. So the ſpiritual Sluggard, tho he is monſtrous idle, prays as if he prayed not, and reads as if it were a Burthen to him, and hears the Word with no delight, his Heart is aſleep, and perhaps his Eyes too; yet he is very wiſe in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Notwithſtanding he is ſuch a poor, carnal, worldly Wretch, he hath high Thoughts of himſelf, and cries out, when reproved, I know as much as you; mind your own Matters; every Tub ſhall ſtand upon its own Bottom; why do you trouble your ſelf with me? Thus every Man is right in his own Eyes, <hi>but the Lord pondereth the Heart.</hi>

So the ſpiritual Sluggard ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to deſire but a little time to gratify his Fleſh, and pleaſe his ſenſual Appetite, to walk in ways of Vanity, and ſin againſt God. I will (ſaith an ungodly Perſon) repent, or 'tis my purpoſe to reform my Ways; but let me alone a little longer, 'tis time enough yet. 'Tis a great while to Day, ſaith the Sluggard, when one comes to awake him early in the Morning: ſo ſaith the Sinner, 'Tis a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt will come, or before old Age and Death will come; in his Heart therefore he is reſolved to continue in his evil and ungodly Courſes a little longer: <hi>Yet a little Sleep, yet a little Slumber, yet a little folding of the Hands to ſleep.</hi> Pray obſerve, how ſweet Sleep ſeems to be to a Sluggard; ſo the Ways of Sin and Vanity ſeem ſweet to an unconverted Man: And as hard Labour is grievous to ſuch a Perſon; ſo is Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (I mean ſtrict and real Godlineſs, Godlineſs in the Power of it) to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified Heart.</cell>

                              <cell>VII. So Sinners who are notoriouſly Guilty before God, love not to meet with him, nor hear of him: if God comes near them by the reproofs of his Word, or by the checks of Conſcience, or by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of the Rod, how are they ſtartled?

                              <cell>VIII. So guilty Sinners are afraid of the Serjeant, Death; if they perceive Death is approaching, how troubled are they for fear of the Priſon of utter Darkneſs? (provided their Conſciences be awake.) See <hi>Sin a Debt.</hi>

                     <p>UNconverted Men are dead, ſpiritually dead, they are as dead Men. Life is oppoſed to Death, which is either the Privation of natural Life, becauſe of the Separation of the Soul from the Body; or the Privation of ſpiritual and heavenly Life, becauſe of the Separation of the Soul from God through Sin. And this is really true in both reſpects, in a proper Sence; yet we ſhall open the State of Men dead in Sin, by comparing this Death with natural Death, between which in ſome things there is a good Parallel, and to which (in the Judgment of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers worthy Men) the Spirit of God doth allude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>A Dead Man, one that is really dead, is under a total Privation of Life; there is no Life in him: So Man by Sin is totally under the Privation of the ſpiritual Life of God. Now the Life of God conſiſteth in a Principle of Grace, which is called a Seed; <hi>The Seed</hi> (ſpeaking of a Man quickned) <hi>remains in him.</hi> This Seed,<note place="margin">1 Joh 3.9.</note> or divine Principle, is unto the Soul, as the Soul is to the Body: but there is no Soul, or Seed of Grace, no Principle of ſpiritual Life in an unregenerate Man; and therefore really and truly dead in a ſpiritual Sence, as the Body is dead when the Soul is ſeparated from it. If there be any true and real ſpiritual Life in an unconverted Man, how can he be ſaid to be dead? for where there is not a total Privation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life, a Man cannot be ſaid to be dead naturally.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="228" facs="tcp:39531:129"/>II. <hi>Dead, the Dead ſhall hear,</hi> &amp;c. This imports, Man was once alive, ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alive, conſidering the Subject of whom our Saviour ſpeaks. Man before his Fall, or the Entrance of Sin, was alive; Death was threatned upon <hi>Adam's</hi> eating of the forbidden Fruit: <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> The Deprivation of the ſpiritual Life of the Soul, as well as the Life of the Body, was in the Sanction of that Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the Death.</hi> What Life ſoever <hi>Adam</hi> had before he fell, he loſt it by his Tranſgreſſion; and in that very Day he eat, he ſuffered a Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Light of God's Countenance, and ſpiritual Life of God in his Soul. He loſt that ſupernatural Power of acting towards God ſpiritually, or Image of God that was in him; ſo that it was impoſſible for him to live any more to God, until quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a new Principle of ſpiritual Life. And hence unregenerate Men are ſaid to be dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. A Man that is dead cannot move, act, or ſpeak; all natural Motions utterly ceaſe; that is the Effect of Death: So unconverted Men have loſt all ſpiritual vital Acts, that is, all Acts and Duties of holy Obedience, acceptable unto God. There is in them a total Defect and Want of Power for any ſuch Acts whatſoever, or elſe they are not dead, cannot be ſaid to be dead; for when the Soul departs, it leaves the Body uncapable of any kind of Activity. All the natural Power the Body had, by means of the Soul's Union with it, is gone, upon the Separation of the one from the other: So Death falling upon the Soul, or ſuffering a Privation of the Image of God, or ſpiritual Life it had, all its internal Power to act or live to God is gone, the the carnal Mind being expreſly ſaid to be Enmity againſt God:<note place="margin">Rom. 8 7.</note> 
                           <hi>An evil Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit.</hi> In ſhort, there is in all wicked Men, a Diſability or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency unto all ſpiritual Things, to be performed in a ſpiritual manner; and that it is impoſſible for them to act and do in a way acceptable to God, till quickned by the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. A dead Man is an unlovely Object to look on; for it is Life that puts a Beauty and Glory upon the Body: So an unregenerate Man is an unlovely Object. 'Tis Grace only, or that ſupernatural Principle of ſpiritual Life, that confers Beauty upon the inward Man, or renders the Soul amiable in God's ſight.</p>

A dead Man is void of all Senſe, he ſees not, feels not, hears not: If you caſt Fire in his Face, 'tis all one to him; or if you run a Sword into his Heart, he will not complain; lay Mountains of Lead upon him, he feels them not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So thoſe who are dead in Sin, are ſenſleſs Souls. Tho the Anger of God is kindled againſt them, and his Wrath burns never ſo hot, they regard it not; nay tho you throw as it were Hell-Fire into their very Faces, yet they fear it not: Tho there are upon them great Mountains of Sin, and horrid Guilt, yet they feel them not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. A dead Man cannot be raiſed to Life again, without the mighty Power of God: So the Dead in Sin cannot be raiſed to Life, without the mighty Power of God's Spirit. Chriſt, who raiſed dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the Grave, muſt quicken ſuch who are dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes. The <hi>Epheſians</hi> are ſaid to <hi>believe according to the Working of God's mighty Power,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. A dead Man is loathſom, and fit for nothing but to be put under Ground, or buried out of ſight: So the Wicked are loathſom in God's ſight, and unleſs the ſooner quickned, they will be good for nothing but to be caſt into Hell; ſome wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Men are fit to be buried, or thrown into that Grave.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> It is by ſome objected, That there is a wide Difference between Death natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpiritual: In Death natural, the Soul it ſelf is utterly removed and taken away from the Body, but in Death ſpiritual it continues: a Man is ſtill, notwithſtanding this ſpiritual Death, endowed with an Underſtanding, Will, and Affections, by which theſe Men are enabled to perform their Duties to God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In Life ſpiritual, the Soul is unto the Principle of it, as the Body is unto the Soul in Life natural:<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
                           </note> For in Life natural, the Soul is the quickning Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and the Body is the Principle quickned; when the Soul departs, it leaves the Body with all its own natural Properties, but utterly deprived of them which it had by virtue of its Union with the Soul: So in Life ſpiritual, the Soul is not, in and by its eſſential Properties, the <hi>quickning Principle</hi> of it, but it is the Principle that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:39531:129"/> is quickned: and when the quickning Principle of ſpiritual Life departs, it leaves the Soul with all its natural Properties entire as to their Eſſence, tho mortally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, (which is equivalent with Death natural); but of all the Power and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which it had by virtue of its Union with a quickning Principle of ſpiritual Life, it is deprived. And to deny there is ſuch a quickning Principle of Life ſpiritual, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added unto us by the Grace of God, diſtinct and ſeparate from the natural Faculties of the Soul, is upon the matter to renounce the whole Goſpel; it is all one as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the Image of God, which he loſt; or that Sinners are ſpiritually dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes; and that we are renewed into the Image of God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whatſoever the Soul acts in ſpiritual Things by its Underſtanding, Will, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, &amp;c. as deprived of, or not quickned by this Principle of ſpiritual Life; it doth it naturally, not ſpiritually, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>A Man naturally dead is altogether uncapable to make any oppoſition againſt the ſupernatural Power of God, put forth in order to quicken him, or raiſe him to Life, he can no way, directly or indirectly oppoſe it. But a Man who is dead, ſpiritually dead in Sin, when God in a gracious way comes to uſe Means to quicken him, or raiſe him to a State of Life, he makes oppoſition, nay; and doth greatly reſiſt and ſtrive againſt the good Motions of the Spirit, and Workings of God, in order to his Vivification. So that the Power of God is more manifeſtly ſeen in the quickning of one ſpiritually dead, than in quickning one dead naturally.</p>

                        <p>FRom hence we may perceive the evil and deſtructive Nature of Sin: It is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually the Death and Ruine of the Soul, and will, without the infinite Mercy of God, deſtroy it for ever.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. It ſhews alſo particularly, what the Nature of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin was, and what it did incur upon his Poſterity, <hi>viz.</hi> not only natural Death, but ſpiritual Death likewiſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. It ſets forth the Riches of God's Grace in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that quickning Spirit, in raiſing poor dead Souls to Life again.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Here is much Comfort for all ſincere Chriſtians, who are raiſed from Death to Life by Chriſt, in that there is ſo great a difference between the State of <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, and our ſtanding in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Principle of Life in <hi>Adam</hi> was wholly and entirely in himſelf. It was the Effect of God's good Will and Power, 'tis true, but it was left to grow on no other Root but what was in Man himſelf; it was wholly implanted in his Nature, and therein did its Spring lie: But in the Life whereinto we are renewed by Chriſt Jeſus, the Fountain and Principle of it is not in our ſelves, but in him, as a common Root of Head: <hi>He is our Life. Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> He is the Spring and Fountain of it. He by Covenant alſo hath undertook to maintain Life in us; he doth renew and encreaſe this Life in us, ſo that it is impoſſible that we ſhould ſpiritually die for ever.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. A Man alſo from hence may eaſily perceive, whether he be made alive, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit, or no. (1.) A Man that hath Life in him, breaths: So he that is ſpiritually alive, breaths forth his Soul in fervent Deſires to God; Prayer (as ſome have obſerved) being the Breath of the new Creature. Hence God, when he would convince <hi>Ananias</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> was regenerated, ſaid, <hi>Behold, he prayeth.</hi> (2.) There is in him Heat, ſpiritual Heat and Zeal God-ward. (3.) He hath his ſpiritual Senſes; he can ſee, feel, hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (4.) 'Tis a full Evidence a Man is alive, when he riſes up, and walks: So a ſpiritual Man riſes up, and walks in neweneſs of Life. (5.) A Man quickned hath his Beauty reſtored again: So a Man ſpiritually quickned, hath the Image of God reſtored; he is holy, heavenly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>SOme Men are born blind. All Mankind ſpiritually may be ſaid to be born blind; for as they are under a Privation of Life, it follows they are blind, that is, their Underſtanding is darkned.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Some Men are blind caſually, either by Age, or ſome Accident. <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, could ſee; originally Man's Eye-ſight was good, but Sin hath put his Eyes out.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Blind Men have not the comfortable Benefit of the Sun: So wicked Men receive not the heavenly and ſweet Benefit of the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>Tho the Sun ſhines never ſo bright, a blind Man is never the better for it, unleſs his Eyes were opened: So tho the Goſpel be preached never ſo powerfully, yet wicked Men ſee not, nor can they, till the Eyes of their Underſtanding are enlightned.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Blind Men ſtumble, and know not many times at what they ſtumble; they alſo are in great Danger, without a ſure Guide: So wicked Men know not what they ſtumble at; they ſtumble at God himſelf, and at Chriſt, when they ſtumble at his Truth, and his People: They know not whither they go, nor the dreadful Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they are in; they think they are in the right Way to Heaven, and yet are in the broad Way to Hell; they are led oft-times by thoſe who are as blind as themſelves; <hi>And if the Blind lead the Blind, they will both fall into the Ditch.</hi>

                        <p n="2">II. Men who are naturally blind, do gladly accept of a faithful and ſure Guide: But wicked Men, who are ſpiritually blind, refuſe that Guide God directs them to, <hi>viz.</hi> his holy Word; they are neither thankful to God, nor good Men, for any Help afforded them; nay, they vilify ſuch as would take them by the hand to ſave them out of the Pit of eternal Miſery. There is no Blindneſs like ſpiritual Blindneſs. Call upon wicked Men, and entreat them never ſo often and earneſtly, Pray do not go that Way, take heed, Man, O take heed! there is a Pit before you; alas! you are going into the Lion's Den, nay, worſe, into everlaſting Fire, to Death and Hell: Yet theſe blind Wretches will go on, live or die, ſink or ſwim, all is one; no Advice or Warning will be received.</p>

                     <p>WIcked Men are ſet forth in the Scripture as Men out of their Wits, Men diſtracted, mad Men: And truly the Choice they make, their Actions; and Behaviour ſhew, as if they were indeed beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they are really void of right Reaſon, or Men that have loſt their ſpiritual Underſtanding.</p>

                        <p>A Mad Man is one that is deprived of his natural Reaſon, a Beaſt (as it were) in the ſhape of a Man: So all the Ungodly of the Earth have loſt their ſpiritual Reaſon, they are Men of no Underſtanding, and more fitly may be ſaid to be Beaſts in the form or ſhape of Men, than ſuch as have loſt their humane Reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Some mad Men are deſperate, and very miſchievous, care not what hurt they do: O how deſperate are wicked Men! how will they ſwear, curſe, and blaſpheme the holy Name of God, and dare God to damn them; and for Miſchief, they delight in nothing more, ſpoiling and utterly deſtroying their innocent Neighbours.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Mad Men are uſually bound, leſt they ſhould proceed too far in their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Ways: So God chains up, or puts wicked Men into Bonds, limits their Power, leſt they ſhould go too far in their cruel and miſchievous Deſigns againſt his People.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Mad Men are uſually committed to Priſon: So wicked Men are under the curſed Bondage and Slavery of Satan, who takes them captive at his Will.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. A mad Man will even ſpit in the Face of his deareſt Friend, who with much Affection ſeeks his Good: So wicked Men do as it were ſpit in the very Faces of God's faithful Miniſters, who in Bowels of tender Love and Compaſſion ſeek their Good; and is this any marvel, when they in a baſe manner ſpit in the Face of Chriſt himſelf?</p>

                           <q>Firſt, he ſtops the roaring of the Lions, they ſhall not be able to make ſuch a dreadful noiſe as heretofore; their roaring may be ſtopt when their Voice is not, tho they can ſpeak, yet they ſhall not yell.</q>

                           <q>Secondly, In the ſecond place, He breaks the Voice of the Lions, they ſhall only not roar, but they ſhall not ſo much as ſpeak, either againſt the Lambs, or againſt the Sheep, or for themſelves, <hi>The Voice of the fierce Lion ſhall be taken away.</hi> God is able to ſilence Lions and ſtop their Mouths, not only from devouring and roaring, but from ſpeaking.</q>

                           <q>Fourthly, Chriſt deals further with theſe Lions, he not only breaks their Teeth by which they uſed to hurt others, but he takes away their Prey and their Meat; they ſhall not have wherewith to live themſelves, they were wont to ſuck the Blood of the Slain, and to eat the Fleſh of the Poor; but now the Lord will pluck away their Prey, they themſelves ſhall be ſtarved or pinched with Hunger.</q>

                           <q>Laſtly, Not only ſhall their Meat be taken away, but they themſelves ſhall be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and diſperſed; this is the laſt ſtep of their calamity.

                           <q>Who hath not ſeen the Truth of all this in our days? We have had Lions, roaring Lions, rending, tearing Lions amongſt us: It was uſual among the Heathen in their Perſecutions to cry out, <hi>Away with the Chriſtians to the Lions!</hi> this we have often ſeen, in the Figure, poor Chriſtians ſent to the Lions; put under the Power of Men, as cruel, as bloody, as Lions. Many an one might ſay (as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 57.4.) <hi>My Soul is among Lions.</hi> When the Watchmen (in the Prophet) was asked, <hi>Watch-man, what of the Night?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>A Lion, my Lord,</hi> (Iſa. 21.8.) Our ſorrowful Watch-men ſtanding upon their Towers (conſidering theſe ſad times, being asked, <hi>What of the Day?</hi> have anſwered, <hi>We ſee a Lion, a company of Lions, tearing and rending in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of the Nation;</hi> not Bodies and States only, but Souls and Conſciences. God hath wonderfully delivered his Darling from the Lions, his <hi>Daniels</hi> from the Lions
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:39531:135"/> Den. He hath already delivered ſo far, that the Lions dare not roar, as they were wont, the Teeth of many of the young Lions are broken, many of the old Lions are ready to periſh for want of Prey, and not a few of their Whelps are ſcattered abroad. God hath raiſed up <hi>Sampſons</hi> to tear theſe Lions, which roared upon us, he hath ſtirred up <hi>Davids</hi> to ſmite theſe Lions, and reſcue the Prey out of their Teeth; and tho many Lions are amongſt us, yet they dare not roar, much leſs, tear as they have done; tho the Beaſts be alive, yet (for the moſt part) the Lions are dead: they are Beaſts ſtill, as baſe, vile, and bloody in their Natures as ever, but their powerful Lion-like Strength is abated. That glorious Prophecy is in ſome ſence, and in ſome part fulfilled at this day, <hi>The Wolf dwells with the Lamb, the Leopard lies down with the Kid, and the Calf and the young Lion, and the fatling together, and a little Child may lead them; they cannot, they dare not, hurt nor deſtroy in all our Mountain,</hi> Iſa. 11.6, 8.

                        <p>
                           <q>Further, It is here ſaid in the Text, <hi>That the old Lion ſhall periſh for want of Prey.</hi> It is a ſtrange Expreſſion; Lions have the greateſt Power to get Proviſion to ſatisfy their Hunger, yea their Appetites and Humour; yet theſe ſhall want, theſe Lions who have all their life time preyed upon the States of other Men, even theſe ſhall want; Note hence the Juſtice of God, <hi>Such as have made others want, ſhall at laſt come to want themſelves, they ſhall periſh for want of Prey;</hi> they ſhall have nothing to eat, <hi>When thou ceaſeſt to ſpoil, thou ſhalt be ſpoiled,</hi> ſaith the Prophet; <hi>And when thou ſhalt make an end to deal treacherouſly, they ſhall deal treacherouſly with thee.</hi> We muſt not underſtand it, as if wicked Men do ever give over ſinning; Sin, and their deſire of ſinning, is in a kind Infinite: they never ſay, Now we have done, and will ſin no more; but the meaning is, when thou canſt ſin no more, nor deal treacherouſly no more; when thou haſt done thy utmoſt, and ſpent thy Strength in ſpoiling others, or taken all their Spoil, ſo that thou haſt done ſpoiling, becauſe there is no more to ſpoil; then others ſhall ſpoil thee. And thou Lion, who haſt preyed upon others along time, ſhalt not have a bit thy ſelf, but ſhalt periſh for want of Prey.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>It is the Promiſe of God unto his own People, Pſal. 34.10. <hi>That the Lions ſhall lack and ſuffer Hunger, but they that fear the Lord, ſhall not want any good Thing:</hi> he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it by Lions, to note, that certainly they that fear him, ſhall not want; for if any Creatures in the World can preſerve themſelves from Hunger, Lions can; if they do but roar, the very Beaſts will fall down as a Prey before them: but yet (ſaith God) theſe, even theſe ſhall rather periſh for Hunger, than any one that feareth me ſhall want. God provides for his Lambs, for innocent Perſons, for thoſe that fear him, tho they have no Strength to provide for themſelves; but the Wicked who have greateſt Power, and have been moſt active to provide for themſelves, ſhall pine with want; they who have cauſed ſo many to be bitten with Hunger, ſhall at laſt be Hunger-bitten, and for want of Meat gnaw their Tongues.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Laſtly, Where it is ſaid, that the Lions Whelps are ſcattered abroad, obſerve, <hi>God will not only deſtroy the Perſons of Wicked Men, but their Families and Poſterities,</hi> they and their Whelps ſhall all be ſcattered, <hi>He will not leave them ſo much as a Man or a Remembrance,</hi> Pſal. 36.6. <hi>I ſought his place</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>and he could not be found,</hi> there was no print of him, no Man could remember that there was ſuch a Man in the World, unleſs to curſe his Memory.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I ſhall only give one caution concerning this, and ſo conclude the Point: That which is here affirmed in the General by <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> concerning the deſtruction of Wicked Men, Lions, and fierce Lions, is not to be taken as a Truth in the univerſal Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it; we are not to underſtand it thus, as if all Perſons, all Lion-like Perſons, at all times, periſh, are deſtroyed, and ſcattered abroad; but <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks of what is uſually done; or he ſpeaks of what God can eaſily do at any time, and of what God may juſtly do at all times. Lions, fierce Lions, Tyrants, Oppreſſors, he both may, and can ſcatter when he pleaſeth, yet we find, that God hath permitted ſome Lions, to live long, and die quietly; they ſpend all their days in roaring and rending, in tearing and devouring, and yet themſelves are not devoured: God ſuſpends his Juſtice, but it is for weighty reaſons. For in word,</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Firſt, If God ſhould deſtroy all Lion-like Men, the Joints of the World would be uncloſed, and the Bands of human Society broken aſunder. God forbad the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to deſtroy all the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> leſt the Beaſts of the Field ſhould multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <q>Secondly; If God ſhould hunt all theſe Lions out of the World, his own People would live by Senſe, rather than by Faith, and ſeem to be terrified by the viſible Actings of Wrath, rather than allured by the Promiſes of Mercy, or Tenders of free Grace.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Thirdly; He defers them, until they have ſuck'd Blood enough, rent enough, done Evil enough, even fill'd up the meaſure of their Sin, and fulfilled the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Purpoſe of God, by their Unrighteouſneſs. As theſe Lions fill their own Bellies, ſo they fulfill God's Counſels; therefore he lets them alone, that they may do his Work, tho they little think of it, and leſs intend it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Laſtly; <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks of what God did frequently in thoſe Times of the World wherein he lived; for then God dealt more by outward Judgments, than in theſe Goſpel-Times. As his Mercies are now more ſpiritual, ſo uſually are his Judgments.</q>

                        <p>SOme are Thieves from their Childhood, they begin betimes to ſteal and rob: So the Ungodly begin betimes to be Wicked, they are ſaid to go aſtray from the Womb, telling Lies, and are by Nature prone to all manner of Sin and Wickedneſs; hereby depriving God of that Honour, Fear, and Reverence, that belongs to him.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Thieves love not the day, leſt they ſhould be diſcovered, but are buſy and active in the Night: So Wicked Men hate the Light, <hi>They love Darkneſs rather than Light,</hi>

                        <p n="3">III. Thieves run many Hazards and Dangers, venture their Lives to accompliſh their Deſigns: So Wicked Men run great Hazards and Dangers, venture not only the Life of their Bodies, but of their Souls alſo, to fulfil their Deſigns and wicked Purpoſes.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Thieves are a great Terrour to honeſt Men, they put many in fear: So ſome Wicked and Ungodly Men are a great Trouble, Grief and Terrour to thoſe who are Godly; how was the Soul of righteous <hi>Lot</hi> vexed with the filthy Converſation of the <hi>Sodomites?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Thieves greatly abuſe, rob and wrong others, not only ſuch as are of their own Rank and Quality; but ſometimes ſet upon, and rob Perſons in Authority; the Judg, nay and Prince himſelf, hath been ſometimes robbed and abuſed by Thieves: Did not <hi>Tho. Blood</hi> but few Years ſince, ſteal the King's Crown? So Wicked Men greatly abuſe their Neighbours, they do often take away the good Name of ſuch who truly fear God, and ſometimes attempt their Chaſtity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is not all, they do not only thus endeavour to rob Men, ſuch who are poor Mortals like themſelves; but they rob God: and that many ways. (1.) They rob him of his Glory. And (2.) Of their own Strength and Flower of their Age, which belongs to him. (3.) They rob him of their Hearts and Affections, and place it upon the World and their own baſe Luſts. (4.) They rob him of their precious Time, and ſquander it away in a fooliſh and idle manner, upon their Luſts; nay, hath not that Man of Blood (I mean the Pope) robbed <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> of his Crown and Royal Diadem? doth he not aſſume that Power and Head-ſhip to himſelf, that only belongs to the Prince of the Kings of the Earth?</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Thieves oft-times Kill as well as Steal, and Kill in Stealing, ſo that they make th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="7">VII. Thieves are ſometimes taken in the Fact, or by Purſuit are apprehended, and laid Hands on, that they may anſwer the Law in that Caſe made and provided: So Wicked Men are ſometimes taken in their Wickedneſs, by the Hand of God; or if they eſcape an immediate Stroak in the very Act of Sin, yet they are purſued by God's juſt Judgment that followeth them, and will overtake them at laſt.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Thieves, when taken, would fain make an eſcape; nay, if they are not held by ſtrong Hand's, they will get looſe and run away: So Wicked Men when God's Hand is upon them how fain would they make an eſcape? when <hi>Adam</hi> fell in with the Tempter to rob God of his Honour, it is ſaid, he hid himſelf among the Trees of the Garden, Guilt made him fly; and what pitiful Shifts do all old <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children make,

Or if they cannot make excuſe, then they ſeek out ways to eſcape if poſſible: Some ſay, their Sins are not ſo great as others; others ſay, they were drawn in and inticed; others, that God is merciful, and they doubt not but he will pardon them; others fly to the goodneſs of their Hearts; ſome to ſeeming Repentance, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God forgive me, &amp;c.</hi> But what ever way they take, till they are truly converted, they are holden by the Cords of their own Sins, and they ſhall not eſcape, nor can get out of God's Hand, but muſt anſwer for all their Wickedneſs at their utmoſt peril.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Some Thieves are ſo impudent, that they will adventure to rob in the day time, let who will look on, being too ſtrong for the Standers-by: So ſome Wicked Men are ſo impudent, that they will adventure to rob their innocent Neighbours of their Goods in a publick manner in the day-time; as many of the Papiſts have ſerved the poor Proteſtants in former times, in divers Nations, and pretended they had Law for what they did.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Some are great Thieves, and therefore called the Captains of the Thieves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Conduct and Direction the leſſer Thieves do rob and ſteal: So ſome Wicked Men are ſo notorious in Wickedneſs, that they lead the Van as it were, and are not only examples to others of inventing new coined Oaths, and ſinful Faſhions, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms; but do command or lay ſome kind of force upon ſuch, who are under their Power, to be as Wicked as themſelves, elſe they turn them off as not fit to do them Service:<note place="margin">Pro. 29.12.</note> as it is written; <hi>If a Ruler hearken to Lies, all his Servants are wicked,</hi> (that is) he will ſo diſcountenance and diſcourage Truth and honeſt Dealing, that none but Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Wicked Perſons can live with him.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Some Thieves are ſo mercileſs, they ſteal and carry all away that People have: So ſome Perſecutors have been ſo void of pity and humanity, that they have took all away, which ſome Godly People had, even their very Beds from under them.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. There are ſome ſacrilegious Thieves, ſuch as rob Churches, and ſteal away thoſe things that are ſet a-part for Divine Worſhip: So ſome Wicked Men are Robbers of the Church of God, by taking away his holy Inſtitutions, and ſetting their Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the room thereof; ſuch are the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Crew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt tells us, that ſuch who come not in by the Door, but climb up ſome other way, are Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: nay if it were poſſible, the Great Thief the Pope, and his Accomplices, would have robbed us of the Bible, and the true Religion, nay of the true Church it ſelf; however they (with all that adhere to them) have robbed many hundreds, nay thouſands, of her true and faithful Members, both of their Goods, Lives and Liberties, for the which they muſt giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="13">XIII. Thieves are ſo oppoſite to honeſt Men, that they by all means avoid their Company and Society, if poſſible, when they know them: So Wicked Men, known and diſcovered to be ſo, are not at all fit Company for the Godly; nay the Godly are commanded to avoid them, and to have no fellowſhip with them, ſo far as poſſible they may; however if in Civil Things there be ſome kind of Neceſſity to buy and ſell with them, yet their Sin in that, or any other way, is to be hated and departed from; nay if a Man hath been a Profeſſor of Godlineſs, and turn to be a Wicked Man, with ſuch a one the Godly are to have no intimacy,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> that he may be aſhamed.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Thieves know by-ways, and are acquainted with ſuch Places where they may accompliſh their Deſigns, not only as to Secrecy, but Security: So Wicked Men do acquaint themſelves with by-ways, and therefore called the way of the Wicked, <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his way,</hi>

                        <p n="15">XV. Thieves are ſometimes taken and committed to Priſon, there to be kept ſafe till the general Aſſize, or time of Trial, and then are brought forth, tryed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, many times to die, and ſoon after executed: So Wicked Men are taken by Death, and committed to the Grave, and there they are held faſt till the day of the Reſurrection, and laſt Judgment or great Aſſize, where they ſhall be tryed, and give

                        <p n="2">II. Thieves endeavour to hide themſelves, and are not willing to be known: But Wicked Men commit their Wickedneſs publickly, and matter not who ſeeth them, they declare their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not, they are not aſhamed to commit their Wickedneſs in the very Face of the Sun.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Thieves oft-times ſpare the Poor, and let them paſs, but ſeize upon ſuch as are Rich: But Wicked Men regard neither Poor nor Rich, if they are Godly; nay the Poor of this World (tho Rich in Faith) are moſtly in their Eye, to be made a ſpoil, robbed and ruined by them.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Some Thieves after they have received the juſt Sentence of Death, from which they cannot eſcape, yet do repent of their Wickedneſs and receive pardon of God, tho they die by the Law of Man: But Wicked Men, living and dying in Sin, after the laſt Judgment, and Sentence of Eternal Death, cannot repent, neither have they any time ſo to do, but muſt be damned without Remedy.</p>

He takes ſome Taſtes of the Pleaſure and Delight of Sin, it ſeems to him as a ſweet Morſel under his Tongue; and this is a Sign of a further degree of Hardneſs. (3.) The third Step is, Cuſtom in ſinning; it argues great Boldneſs to venture often. (4.) And then in the next place, he defends and maintains his Sin, he has got ſome Plea or Argument for it, he is an Advocate for Sin. (5.) He is angry with them, and ſecretly hates them in his Heart, that reprove him for his Sin, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him againſt ſuch and ſuch wicked Ways. (6.) He grows ſoon after this Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-proof, and Sermon-proof, nay, and Judgment-proof too; he neither fears Rod nor Sword; a Stone will yield as ſoon as he. (7.) He after this ſits down in the Seat of the Scorner, derides and reproaches the Law, and mocks at approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, like the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> (8.) And at laſt becomes a Perſecutor of them that are godly, like curſed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>EAgles are very ſwift in their Flight, and that eſpecially when they purſue their Prey: So cruel Perſecutors are ſwift to ſhed Blood:<note place="margin">Iſa, 5.26.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. Eagles are quarrelſom Creatures, preying, devouring, envious, proud, lofty, the Plague and Tormenters of all other Birds or Fowls of Heaven, (as Naturaliſts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.) <hi>Geſner</hi> reports, that in a certain Eagle's Neſt were found three hundred Ducks, one hundred and ſixty Geeſe, forty Hares, and many Fiſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In theſe reſpects wicked Men, or bloody Perſecutors, may fitly be compared to them: They are very quarrelſom, always ſeeking occaſion againſt the Innocent; envious, proud, and lofty, as appeared in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and others. They are the very Plague and Torment of all their Neighbours. How many hath the Roman Eagle deſtroyed! how many Thouſands, nay, Hundred Thouſands of the Sheep and Lambs of Jeſus Chriſt have been found in her Neſt! (as I may ſo ſay.) <hi>In her was found the Blood of Prophets,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 18.24</note> 
                           <hi>and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Eagle is a ſubtil and crafty Creature: She will fill her Wings with Duſt, and get upon a Stag's Horns, and by beating the Duſt and Sand into his Eyes ſhe blinds him, and then ſoon conquers him. She alſo carries Shell-Fiſhes on high, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them fall upon a Rock to break them; which ſets forth her great Subtilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How crafty have many Perſecutors been to deſtroy the Godly! <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pharaoh, let us deal wiſely with them.</hi> Their common Practice is, to put the Saints into Wolves Skins, and then ſet the Dogs upon them, to worry them. Chriſt was accuſed for being an <hi>Enemy to Caeſar,</hi> and the Apoſtles, as <hi>Movers of Sedition.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Acts 24.5.</note> Thus the cruel Papiſts dealt with the good Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and many other Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> accuſed them with Treaſon and Rebellion, that ſo they might with the better colour take away their Lives.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. An Eagle is an unclean Creature, and therefore God would not have it to be offered up in Sacrifice; tho ſhe be accounted the King of Birds, yet God rather choſe the Dove upon this account, and refuſed the Eagle: So wicked Men are unclean, and their Prayers and Sacrifices, yea, their beſt Performances,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.8, 9.</note> are an Abomination in the ſight of the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. An Eagle is no comely Bird, ſhe hath no ſweet Voice, nor is ſhe good for Food: So wicked Men are not comely, but contrary-wiſe, very fulſom and ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in God's ſight, neither is their Voice ſweet in his Ears. Chriſt takes great delight to ſee his People, and in hearing their Voice. <hi>Let me ſee thy Countenance,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Cant. 2.14</note> 
                           <hi>let me hear thy Voice; for ſweet is thy Voice, and thy Countenance is comely.</hi> But thus he ſpeaks not of the Ungodly: their Perſons and Prayers are no ways delightful to the Almighty. <hi>God had reſpect to</hi> Abel, <hi>and his Offering; but unto</hi> Cain, <hi>and his Offering,</hi>

                     <p>VIle and ungodly Men may in many reſpects be compared unto the Devil himſelf.</p>
                     <div type="parallels">
                        <head>Parallels.</head>
                        <p>THe Devil at firſt was formed or created by the Almighty; I do not ſay, he was created a Devil, Sin made him a Devil, but God at firſt made him; he was created an Angel of Light: So God created wicked Men; they are God's Creatures:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.29.</note> Tho God at firſt made no Man wicked: <hi>The Lord created Man upright, but he hath ſought out many Inventions.</hi> 'Tis Sin that hath made Man ſo vile.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The Devil then is grievouſly degenerated from what he once was; ſo are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Men from what they were in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Devil is an Enemy to God; he was God's firſt Enemy: So are wicked Men curſed Enemies of God, and early Enemies too: 'Tis thought Man became God's Enemy not many days after Satan fell; he is almoſt as old an Enemy as the Devil is.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The Devil conſpired like a vile Traitor againſt his lawful Sovereign: So have all the ungodly ever done, and ſtill daily do: They would not have God reign, nor his Laws be obeyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but would magnify themſelves, and their curſed Edicts; above the righteous Laws and Statutes of Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The Devil ſins freely, naturally, with full purpoſe, and cannot but ſin: So wicked Men ſin freely, 'tis ſweet and pleaſant to them, 'tis like ſweet Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They delight in Sin;<note place="margin">Eccleſ 8.11. Job 15.16. Jer. 13.3. 2 Pet. 2.24</note> their Hearts (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays) are fully ſet in them to do wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly: <hi>They drink in Iniquity, as the Fiſh drinks Water. Can the</hi> Aethiopian <hi>change his Skin? then may they who are accuſtomed to do Evil, learn to do well.</hi> Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Having their Eyes full of Adultery, and that cannot ceaſe from Sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The Devil hates thoſe that are truly godly, and ſeeks to beguile and deceive them: So wicked and ungodly Men hate the Saints, and ſtrive to entice and draw away their Hearts from God and his Ways. Hence, as Satan is called a Deceiver, and a Serpent, ſo are ſome of his Children.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The Devil's great deſign is to encourage Vice and all Prophaneneſs, and by one means or another to ſuppreſs real Godlineſs: So this is the great Deſign and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of ſome wicked Men.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The Devil is ſo vile, that God ſeeth it neceſſary to lay a reſtraint upon him, and put him into Chains, or elſe the World would not have a Moment's time of Peace and Quiet: So ungodly Men are ſo much like the Devil in this, that God alſo ſees the like need to reſtrain them: for as the Devil is boundleſs in his Wrath, Rage, and Malice againſt Mankind; ſo are his curſed Emiſſaries againſt their Fellow-Creatures: Hence God puts a Hook into their Jaws, and ſets Bars to theſe ſwelling Seas.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. The Devil trembles at the thoughts of God's Wrath, and dreads the Day that is coming: So do wicked Men fear him, not becauſe they love him, but becauſe they are his Enemies, and as ſuch, they fear he will one day reckon with them.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. The Devil tempts to Sin; he is not contented to be vile himſelf, but he would fain have others be vile and ungodly as well as he: So wicked Men tempt, entice, and draw others to Sin; they are not content to be ungodly themſelves, but ſtrive to defile and corrupt others alſo.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. The Devil is a Murtherer, a great Murtherer, and takes delight in ſhedding of Blood,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> and making Deſolation in the Earth, hence called a Lion, and a Dragon: So wicked Perſecutors are in this the very Picture of the Devil, <hi>viz.</hi> great Murtherers; their Feet run ſwift to ſhed Blood. How many thouſands of innocent Souls have the bloody Roman Devils deſtroyed within theſe twelve hundred Years! They delight in ſpoiling, and making deſolate the Inhabitants of the Earth, who oppoſe their Pride,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.4. Pſal. 44.19</note> or ſtand in the way of their Exaltation; and thence they are called Lions and Dragons likewiſe.</p>
                        <p n="12">
                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:39531:142"/>XII. The Devil would fain make thoſe who fear God miſerable in this World, he envies their Happineſs, and if he was but let looſe upon them, he would utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Goods, of their Children, of their Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and bring them into a forlorn and miſerable Condition, as he dealt with holy <hi>Job:</hi> So ſome wicked Men in this are like the Devil, they envy the Peace and Proſperity of God's People, and if God did not reſtrain them, (were it in their Power) they would rob them of all their Goods, (as ſome have attempted of late,) nay, and deſtroy their Off-ſpring. How many innocent Babes did the Papiſts deſtroy in the Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> crying out, <hi>Spare them not, Nits will become Lice!</hi> They grutch them their Liberty; and therefore (ſaith God) <hi>The Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Rev. 2 10.</note> Is the Devil come to be a Purſevant, or an Officer, or to give Warrants to caſt into Priſon? No, but it is ſpoken of wicked Perſecutors, that the Devil ſets on work.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. The Devil is an Accuſer, one that vilifies and reproaches all ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; he is called the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren:</hi> Wicked Men are in this alſo like the Devil, they love to accuſe and vilify the Godly in the Land; as <hi>Tertullus</hi> ſerved <hi>Paul,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Acts 24.3, 5.</note> 
                           <hi>We have found this Man a peſtilent Fellow, a Mover of Sedition,</hi> &amp;c. They continually labour to render them odious, that ſo they might be hated, and expoſed to the Severity of the Law, and mercileſs Rage of the rude Rabble.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. The Devil is utterly caſt off and forſaken of God, and ſhall have his Portion in the Lake; there is no hope left him for an Eſcape; he knows it will for ever be his Portion: So ſome wicked Men are utterly rejected of God, and given up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Mind, and there is no Hope left for them of eſcaping the Damnation of Hell; they ſhall as ſurely be damned and tormented for ever and ever, as 'tis certain the Devils ſhall. So that in theſe, and many other things that I ſhall paſs by, it appears, wicked Men bear a reſemblance of the Devil, they are like unto him, they have the Image of the Devil upon them; Sin turns a Man into a Devil.<note place="margin">Joh. 6.70.</note> 
                           <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve? and one of you is a Devil.</hi>

                     <q>Theſe Words call not only for a Maintenance of Miniſters, but for ſuch a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contribution, as may make them Partakers with you in all good things. If God bleſs the Congregation with a plentiful Portion of this World's Goods, it is their Duty to make their Miniſter a Party with them in their flouriſhing Condition. And, conſidering the Place and Employment he is in, and the Service he attends, it would be extremely unworthy to think you have done enough, if his preſſing Neceſſities be anſwered, while you abound in Superfluities. If the Congregation be poor, their Miniſter muſt be content to be poor with them, yea, rejoyce to approve himſelf a Miniſter of Chriſt, by Hunger and Nakedneſs, if the Providence of God call him thereto: But whilſt it is in the power of your Hand to provide better for him, God expects it from you; and, <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked,</hi> neither will he ſuffer his Commands to be ſlighted and evaded, without rendring a juſt Rebuke to the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>For whatſoever a Man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi>

                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1. That a Miniſter is bound to attend wholly and only upon his Calling in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and not to entangle himſelf in the Affairs of this Life, that he may pleaſe him by whom he is called to this ſpiritual Warfare; and nothing but real Neceſſity may diſpenſe with the contrary. His whole Time and Strength is little enough to be employed in the Work and Service he is called to. He muſt give himſelf to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word, and Prayer; and continue in Reading, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a Man wholly devoted unto Goſpel-Service; and is therefore, by his Call to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſecluded from thoſe ways and means of providing for his own Subſiſtence, as the Trades and ſecular Employments of others furniſh them with, that his Mind, by the Cares of worldly Buſineſs, may not be diverted from that Study of God's Word, and Care of Souls, which the Duty of his Station engageth him to. And if he may not expoſe himſelf to the careful Thoughts that accompany worldly Buſineſs, tho tending to his Profit; certainly it is no way meet, that he ſhould be left to conflict with the thorny Cares of a neceſſitous Condition, whilſt thoſe he miniſters to, have means to prevent it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. It is no leſs the Duty of a Miniſter, than of other Men, to provide for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.8.</note> and (what lies in him) to take care of his Wife and Children, that they may not be expoſed to a thouſand Miſeries and Temptations, when he is gone. I confeſs, of all Men in the World, a covetous, raking Temper worſt becomes a Miniſter: But we greatly miſtake, if we think he muſt deveſt himſelf of the due Affection of an Husband towards his Wife, or of a Father towards his Children; or, that thoſe Fruits thereof, which are juſtly eſteemed commendable in others, ſhould be a Fault in him.</q>

An Elder or Biſhop is under a ſpecial Charge to uſe Hoſpitality, and to ſet in himſelf a Pattern of Charity, and compaſſionate Bounty to poor Souls; and if it be his Duty to be hoſpitable and charitable in an eminent degree, then without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy the People are concerned to endeavour that he may be capable of giving proof of this Grace in him, by the Exerciſe of it as there is occaſion.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Firſt; The Law and Light of Nature obligeth you to it, as to the matter of Equity and Juſtice. And from hence our Apoſtle takes his firſt Plea, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7, &amp;c. <hi>Who goeth a Warfare any time at his own Charges? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock?</hi> The Miniſtry is a Warfare, undertaken at the Command of Chriſt, for the Service of your Souls; and it is as reaſonable that the Miniſter ſhould receive a Supply of outward Things from you, as that a faithful Souldier ſhould receive his Pay from his Captain, at the Charge of the Commonwealth, for whoſe Good he militates. Shall a Man feed a Flock, (as a Paſtor does) and be denied to eat of the Milk of that Flock, which it is his Work to keep and feed? Or, is it conſiſtent with common Juſtice, to deprive a Man of the Fruit of that Vineyard, which is planted and manured by his own Labour? Such is the Caſe, in reſpect of Maintenance, between a Miniſter and the People. It is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:39531:146"/> not your Charity that I ask for him, but Juſtice and Debt that I plead for: He is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in your Service, and of Right ſhould live upon your Charge; Nay, you have called him off from other Buſineſs, and therefore his Maintenance is due from you, as is the Wages of your Servant; tho I fear ſome give more to the meaneſt Servant in their Houſe, than they are willing to do to their Miniſter. Certainly, if you chuſe as you ought, your Miniſters are not of the loweſt of the People, but may be allowed to have a Share of Parts, common Prudence, and Ability for Buſineſs, with other Men; and could manage Trades, or fall into other Employments, and get Eſtates as well as you, if they were not <hi>devoted to a better Service:</hi> And muſt they needs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Neceſſities and Miſery, in the ſame hour that they enter upon the Miniſtry? My Brethren, this ought not to be. Let your Miniſters have as good a Treatment at leaſt, as the Law provided for the <hi>Ox that treads out the Corn,</hi> who might not be <hi>muzled.</hi> Neither was this written for the ſake of Oxen; for, <hi>doth God take care of Oxen?</hi> or were there no higher End of this Law, than that the brute Creature ſhould not be abuſed? Certainly there was; <hi>And for our ſakes no doubt was this written,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>that he that ploweth, ſhould plow in Hope; and that he that threſheth in Hope, ſhould be Partaker of his Hope: For if we have ſown unto you ſpiritual Things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal Things?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>Secondly; The Lord hath not left us to argue this only from general Principles of Reaſon, and common Equity; but, to put the Matter beyond diſpute, hath ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added his <hi>expreſs Command.</hi> Thus he provided for his Miniſters in the Time of the Law, which the Apoſtle urgeth in the next place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Do ye not know, that they which miniſter about holy Things, live of the Things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are Partakers with the Altar?</hi> God did no ſooner ſeparate the <hi>Levites</hi> to the Service of the Sanctuary, but he by Law provided for their Subſiſtence; and tho they were but one Tribe in twelve, yet the Tenth of the Increaſe of the whole Land was given to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m, beſides the Firſt-fruits and Offerings, and divers other Advantages; ſo that their Lot might equal, yea, exceed that of their Brethren. This Law indeed is now abrogated, and we pretend to no Right of tithing your Eſtates; but the moral Equity of it can never ceaſe: Neither hath Chriſt left Goſpel-Miniſters to the wide World, but hath made Proviſion for them alſo, ſo far as the Intereſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand will go with them that profeſs his Name; for ſo it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> The <hi>Labourer</hi> is ſtill <hi>worthy</hi> of his <hi>Hire,</hi> and not the <hi>leſs worthy,</hi> becauſe he <hi>labours in the Goſpel.</hi> Tho indeed (if Men did fully come up to their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty, yet ſtill) the Charge of Goſpel-Worſhip will appear very inconſiderable, when compared with that of the Law; for, were that my Buſineſs, I think I could demonſtrate, that the fifth part of their Eſtates was yearly to be ſpent in things relating to the Temple-Service. And if we are ſenſible of the great Privilege and Bleſſing of the Goſpel, on higher accounts than meerly the Eaſe of thoſe Burthens, we ſhall never think much to defray the moderate Charge of a Goſpel-Miniſtry, in ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h a manner as may give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to our Profeſſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly; That you may prevent the <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Inconvenience</hi> that follows the Neglect of this Duty, it concerns you cheerfully to practiſe it: I might have ſaid, <hi>Evils</hi> and <hi>Inconveniences,</hi> as of many, for many there are, and thoſe of eaſy obſervation to an u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>prejudiced Eye; but it is the <hi>Diſcouragement of Study,</hi> which at preſent I chiefly aim at. That Study muſt needs be diſcouraged, (I intend the Study of Theology) by the Peoples Neglect to make a comfortable Proviſion for their Miniſters, is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to require a Proof. Who will apply himſelf to gather and lay up thoſe Stores of ſolid Learning, which are needful to a Miniſter, when he can expect to purchaſe nothing to himſelf but Poverty and Diſtreſs thereby? Or, how ſhall a Miniſter be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to furniſh himſelf with <hi>univerſal Knowledg</hi> of Things relating to his Work, that hath no means for providing for his own Information, or no Time free from Cares and worldly Buſineſs? And the Diſadvantage of this will at laſt fall to the Share of the People that he miniſters unto. He that conſiders, that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were originally written in Hebrew and Greek, muſt have an hard Forehead, if he deny the Uſefulneſs of Learning to a Miniſter; beſides, many other things there are that call for it, in reference to the opening of the Scriptures, which I cannot now inſiſt upon. And it is not without diligent and continued Study, that the deep Things of God can be ſearched out, and ſo propoſed to you, as to enrich your Minds with the clear and ſolid Knowledg of them. I confeſs, a little Learning, and leſs Study, may furniſh a Man with ſuch a Diſcourſe, as may pleaſe ſome weak Perſons,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:39531:147"/> that judg of a Sermon by the Loudneſs of the Voice, and affectionate Sentences, or can fancy themſelves to be fed with the Aſhes of jingling Words, and Cadency of Terms in a Diſcourſe. But alas! the ſeeming Warmth of Affection that is ſtirred by ſuch Means, is as ſhort-liv'd, as a Land-flood that hath no Spring to feed it. He that will do the Souls of his People good, and approve himſelf a Paſtor after God's own Heart, muſt feed them with Knowledg and Underſtanding, and endeavour to maintain a conſtant Zeal and Affection in them, by well informing their Judgments, and ſuch an opening of the Mind of God from the Scriptures, as may command their Conſciences: And this is not to be expected, but from him that labours in his Study, as well as in the Pulpit. Miſtake me not; I know the Succeſs and Fruit of all the Studies and Labours of Men that preach in the Goſpel, is from the Grace and Power of the Holy-Ghoſt; but the <hi>Aſſiſtance of the Spirit</hi> is to be expected by us in the <hi>way of our Duty.</hi> Theſe things might be yet applied more home to my preſent purpoſe; but perhaps ſome will think there is too much ſaid already, (tho I heartily wiſh more were not needful) and my Time calls me to put a Period to this Exerciſe; and therefore I will only add a Word for the enforcement of this and the other Duties which I have laid before you, by accommodating the ſame Things to you, which were before touched, for the encouragement and quickning of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor in his Duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Firſt; Remember, your Paſtor is the Miniſter of Chriſt, one that diſpenſeth the Myſteries of God to you in his Name; and therefore (he acting in his Place, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Duty) the Lord Jeſus will account that done to himſelf, that is done to his Miniſter:<note place="margin">Mat 10.40, with Luke 10.16.</note> 
                        <hi>He that receiveth you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>receiveth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me,</hi> &amp;c. If the Name and Authority of Chriſt will beget an Awe in you, or his matchleſs and unſpeakable Love influence you, there is no want of Motives to thoſe Duties that have been preſs'd upon you. If you acknowledg a religious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Reverence due to the Son of God, exerciſe it in humble Obedience to his Word; and if you love him, and value his Goſpel, treat not his Miniſters in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy manner; and forget not, that He, who gave his Life a Ranſom for you, well deſerves a Return of the greateſt Love from you, and to be honoured by you, not only with good Words, but <hi>with your Subſtance, and the Firſt-Fruits of all your Increaſe.</hi>

                     <q>Secondly, 'Tis the Buſineſs of your Salvation, and the Concern of your precious and immortal Souls, that a Miniſter is employed in; and therefore it is much more your own Intereſt than his, that you ſhould make Conſcience of your Duty. With this Argument the Apoſtle enforces his Exhortation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>For they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give an Account, that they do it with Joy, and not with Grief, for that is unprofitable for you.</hi> The Miniſtry can never be effectual to the ſaving of your Souls, if you be not ſincere in Obedience under it. And will you be leſs careful for your Souls, and their eternal Welfare, than you are for your Bodies, and the Comforts of a temporal Life? Can you be content to lay out your Strength and Subſtance to provide for theſe, and neglect the other? It is ſad to conſider, how many there are among Profeſſors, that live in the World, as if there were no Truth in the Report of that which is to come, and have the meaneſt eſteem of the moſt neceſſary Means of Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word, and Ordinances of Chriſt, and a Goſpel-Miniſtry! Can expend perhaps an hundred Pound <hi>per annum,</hi> more or leſs, for the Convenience, Ornament, or Delight of a frail Carcaſe, but will grudg half ſo much for the Poor, or the ſupport of Goſpel-Worſhip.</q>

                              <p>They are to give warning to Sinners, that they repent, and be converted, for Wrath is gone out againſt them from the Lord; if they live in one Sin, they muſt periſh: They are to warn them of the Danger of Unbelief, to warn them of the Danger of the Hardneſs of their Hearts, to warn them of the Danger of Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and all other Sins; to give warning of the Danger of Idolatry, and all falſe Worſhip and Hereſy; of the Danger of Apoſtacy, the Danger of the inordinate Love of the World, or of any thing ſhort of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <hi>ſee, I have made thee a Watchman to the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> 'Tis Chriſt's Prerogative to appoint Watchmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <cell>V. So a Miniſter is appointed to watch not only himſelf, but God's Flock, the whole Flock that is committed to his Charge; yea, every Member of the Church: he is to look after the pooreſt, as well as the richeſt; and not ſeek theirs,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.28. &amp; 12.14.</note> but them.</cell>

                           <cell>VI. Watchmen are to give an account of the time of the Night. Men go to the Watchman to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; he ſays, 'tis ſuch or ſuch an Hour: <hi>Watchman, what of the Night?</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Iſa. 21.12.</note> &amp;c. <hi>The Morning cometh, and alſo the Night.</hi>
                           </cell>
                           <cell>VI. So Chriſt's faithful Miniſters are to give an account of the Night; they ought to be well-skill'd in the Times, to ſhew what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do. O that our Watchmen had more Knowledg upon this account! that they could but tell how long! <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Rom. 13.10, 11.</note> the Night was far ſpent, and the Day was at hand. Our Watchmen begin to ſpeak after the ſame manner: <hi>The Morning cometh,</hi> the Morning of that longed-for Day of Chriſt's Kingdom; <hi>and the Night,</hi> that eternal Night of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Ruine.</cell>

                        <row>
                           <cell>VII. Watchmen are expoſed to Danger, and much Hardſhip; they are oftentimes ſet upon, and baſely abuſed in the Night, whilſt they are upon their Duties, by evil, quarrelſom, and miſchievous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and endure many cold Blaſts.</cell>
                           <cell>VII. So the Miniſters of the Goſpel are often ſet upon whilſt they are upon the Watch. See how it befell <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, Acts</hi> 4. and <hi>Stephen, chap.</hi> 7. and the great Miniſter of the Gentiles, St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. whilſt he was preaching Chriſt: <hi>The Magiſtrates rent off their Clothes, and commanded them to be beaten; and when they had laid many Stripes upon them, they caſt them into Priſon,</hi> &amp;c.</cell>

                        <row>
                           <cell>VIII. Watchmen many times, through their Care and Diligence, by diſcovering approaching Evils, prevent much Danger and Miſery from falling upon Men. Some by this means have been delivered from being burnt in their Beds, when a violent Fire hath broken out ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in the Night; they cry out, Fire, Fire, to awaken People when they are aſleep.</cell>
                           <cell>VIII. So Chriſt's Miniſters, by opening the State and miſerable Condition of poor Sinners to them, and of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſpeedy Repentance, in turning to the Lord, and cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, have prevented great Danger that was near them, (I mean, as Inſtruments in the hand of God.) By this means many poor Souls have been delivered from eternal Burnings in Hell. Miniſters cry out, Fire, Fire, Hell is exceeding hot, to rouſe ſecure Sinners.</cell>

                           <cell>V. So a Miniſter knows, that until the new Stock, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, was cut off, that is to ſay, crucified, no Men, as ſpiritual Syenes, can be grafted into him by a lively Faith: Tho there is in this a great Diſparity (as applied to Miniſters) for Planters cut off or cleave the Stock themſelves, before they graft the Siene; but Chriſt was cut off by another hand.</cell>

                        <row>
                           <cell>VI. A Planter knows, a Twig that is to be grafted, or a Bud ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, muſt firſt be cut off with a Knife that is keen or ſharp, or an Inſtrument, from the Tree on which it naturally grew: And when the Grafts are cut off, in order to this Work, 'tis a critical Seaſon with them (ſaith worthy Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi>) if they lie too long before they are engrafted, or take not with the Stock, they die, and are never more recovered; they may ſtand in the Stock a while, but are no part of the Tree.</cell>
                           <cell>VI. So a Miniſter knows, before a Soul can be grafted into Chriſt, he muſt be cut off of the old Stock, <hi>viz.</hi> old <hi>Adam,</hi> and taken off of his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. The firſt Work upon a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is cutting Work: They were cut or pricked in their Hearts,<note place="margin">Acts 2.37. Heb. 4.</note> while <hi>Peter</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them. <hi>The Word of God is ſharper than a two-edged Sword.</hi> 
                              <q>As no Siene is engrafted without cutting; ſo no Soul is united to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.8, 9.</note> without a true and cutting Senſe of Sin, and of its own Miſery. And when Souls are under a Work of Converſion, 'tis a critical Time with them; many have miſcarried then, and never recovered again: They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for a time remained like dead Grafts in the Stock, by an external, lifeleſs Profeſſion, but never come to any thing; for ſuch dead Grafts in a little time fall off from the Stock, Chriſt, and periſh.</q> But this I muſt needs ſay, it is principally for want of being quite cut off, or becauſe they were never throughly cut
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:39531:153"/> or wounded at Heart; Convictions upon their Hearts were never deep enough, or not kind Convictions, rather Legal than Evangelical; they were not cut by a fit Inſtrument, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

A Planter, when Grafts are cut off, and prepared to be engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, makes all convenient ſpeed he can to cloſe them with the new Stock; the ſooner (ſaith one) that is done, the better. The Graft is intimately united, and cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with the Stock; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is ſo cloſe, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one Tree.</cell>

                              <p>VII. So a Miniſter, when he ſees poor Sinners are fitted, and every way prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by powerful Convictions, ought to make what ſpeed he can to apply the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and direct them to a Cloſure with Chriſt, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Act. 16.30, 31.</note> to believe on the Lord Jeſus. And when this is done, there is an intimate Union betwixt Chriſt and the Souls that believe in him: <hi>He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> 'Tis the neareſt, cloſeſt, and ſtricteſt Union; they are ſo glewed one to the other, ſo that look as the Graft is really in the Stock, and the Sap of the Stock is really in the Graft: So a Believer is really, tho myſtically, in Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt is communicated to a Believer: <hi>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4 16</note> And as the Graft is bound to the Stock ſo ſteadily, that the Wind cannot loſe it; ſo the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul is faſtened to Chriſt by ſuch Bonds,<note place="margin">Flavel.</note> as will ſecure it from all danger of being looſed from him any more.</p>

                           <cell>IX. So is the Miniſter's Work a very hard and laborious Work; no Digger nor Planter works harder, or takes more pains, than ſome faithful Planters, or Preachers of the Goſpel; they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweat at their Work (as we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewed) and by their Study and great Labour, waſte their frail Bodies.

                           <cell>SO St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and other great and wiſe Maſter-Builders, (the Apoſtles) have given plain Directions to us, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Builders, how the Houſe of God muſt be built, and with what Materials; and they have left in the holy Goſpel a plain Scheme or Figure of it, that ſo all ſpiritual Builders may know how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their Work.</cell>

                           <cell>III. So have Miniſters much Rubbiſh to remove out of their own and Sinners Way, before they can proceed in their bleſſed Work. There is the Rubbiſh of Falſe-Doctrine about Juſtification; this was in the Apoſtle's way, as well as 'tis in ours: The Jews were hardly taken off from their own Righteouſneſs, and legal Ceremonies; they would needs build upon a Legal Foundation: <hi>They ſtumbled at the Stumbling Stone,</hi> &amp;c. We have much Popiſh Rubbiſh to remove, the Rubbiſh of Mens Inventions, and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides the Rubbiſh of other Hereticks and Deceivers.</cell>

                           </cell>
                           <cell>IV. So Miniſters find ſome Sinners are very ſtubborn and obſtinate, like knotty Timber, ſcragged and rugged Stones, which, without much Labour and Pains, are not hewed and fitted for the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</cell>

                           <cell>V. So ſhould a Miniſter of the Goſpel ſee that all the ſpiritual Stones and Timber be well ſquared, fitted, and prepared by a through Work of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith, before they are placed or laid into the Building or Church of God. <hi>Prepare thy Work without, and make it fit for thy ſelf in the Field, and then build thy Houſe.</hi>

                           <cell>VI. A Builder can tell how many principal Pillars or Poſts belong unto the Houſe or Building, and ſees to fit all the Materials thereof in their proper place, and will be ſure to ſee that he wants never a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Pillar.</cell>
                           <cell>VI. So Miniſters can tell how many fundamental Principles there are of the Chriſtian Religion, I mean, Principles neceſſary to Salvation; and alſo the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Foundations of Church-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Fellowſhip; and will ſee that every thing they do be done orderly, every thing fitted according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of God's Word; and that they want not any one of the Foundation-Principles of the Chriſtian Religion. 'Tis dangerous, you know, if a Houſe be to be built upon ſix main Pillars, if it want one. Read <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2.</cell>

                           <cell>VII. A Builder has his Rule, by which he doth all his Work: He does not work by Gueſs, nor by the Sight of his own Eye only, but by a certain and unerring Rule.</cell>
                           <cell>VII. So a wiſe Miniſter hath his Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God; he doth not do what he thinks is right in his own Eyes, until he hath tried it by the Rule; nor will he follow the Humor and Fancy of others, who may ſay, this is right, and that is right: but according as he finds Things to agree or diſagree with the holy Scriptures, and Spirit of God, that unerring Rule, by which he receives, or rejects, takes, or leaves: He, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> will do all things according to the Pattern ſhewed in the Mount: <hi>As many as walk according to this Rule, Peace be on them, and Mercy,</hi>

                           <cell>VIII. So a wiſe Miniſter, or ſpiritual Builder, endeavours to ſee that all the Saints be united, fitly framed, or joined together in Love, and well faſtened by Faith, and Love to Jeſus Chriſt. See what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.20, 21, 22.</note> 
                              <hi>And are built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner-Stone; in whom all the Building be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitly framed together, groweth to an holy Temple in the Lord, in whom ye are builded together for an Habitation of God, through the Spirit.</hi>
                           </cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                           <cell>IX. A Builder takes great care to give directions about the Door, or Way into the Houſe he is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and makes it plain, that all People who have a mind, or ought to enter in, may readily find the way, and not ſtumble at the Threſhold.</cell>
                           <cell>
                              <p>IX. So a wiſe and faithful Miniſter takes ſpecial care to give directions about the Door into God's Houſe, that all whom Chriſt would have enter in, may not be at a loſs about it, nor ſtumble as it were at the Threſhold. 'Tis abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, that they are acquainted with, and able to ſhew to others, what are thoſe initiating Ordinances into the Houſe or Church of God. And ſad it is to ſee ſo many worthy Miniſters among us at ſo great a Loſs in this reſpect; as is demonſtrated in a ſmall Treatiſe, written by Mr. <hi>W. R.</hi> entitled, <hi>A ſober Diſcourſe of Right to Church-Communion.</hi> It hath always been aſſerted by Chriſtians of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, (till of late) that Baptiſm in Water, that holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> Chriſt ordained and left in his Church, is abſolutely neceſſary to Church-Fellowſhip and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; though touching the Subject and Manner of the Adminiſtration of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, there hath been much Controverſy: but ſure I am, the Word of God is very full and plain in this Caſe.</p>
                              <p>1. The Lord Jeſus hath poſitively enjoined Repentance, Faith, and Baptiſm, to be taught as the firſt Principles of his ſacred Doctrine, and as Fundamentals of Church-Communion and Fellowſhip. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2.</p>
                              <p>2. This alſo was the Door the holy Apoſtles (thoſe wiſe Maſter-Builders) directed Perſons to, and opened for entrance in the Primitive Time: <hi>Repent, and be baptized, every one of you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then they that gladly received the Word, were baptized; and the ſame Day there was added unto them about three thouſand Souls.</hi> Acts 2.40, 41. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with <hi>Acts</hi> 8.48. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.33. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. And hence 'tis ſaid; <hi>By one Spirit are
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:39531:155"/> we all baptized into one Body,</hi> or to be of one Body. Moreover, as it is in the above-cited Treatiſe proved, upon an Examination of the Records of the next Age after the Apoſtles, 'tis evident, the ſame Order was retained and kept up, as appears by <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in his Apology to <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> the Roman Emperor. <q>This Food (ſaid he) we call the Euchariſt, to which no Man is admitted, but only he that believeth in the Truth of the Doctrine, being waſhed in the Laver of Regeneration, (ſo he called Baptiſm) for the Remiſſion of Sins, and that ſo liveth as Chriſt hath taught.</q> 
                                 <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> poſitively affirm the ſame, and divers others of the ancient Fathers; as <hi>Baſil, Nazianzen, Optatus, Athanatus, Epiphanius, Hilarius, Ambroſe, Jerome, Sozomen, Athanaſius, Auguſtin,</hi> &amp;c. as is largely ſhewed by the Divines of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> in their Hiſtory of the Church, printed at <hi>Baſil,</hi> 1624. Alſo all our modern Divines fully agree with the Ancients in this great Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſm is abſolutely an initiating Ordinance, and that no unbaptized Perſon ought to be admitted into the Church, nor to the Lord's Supper; tho 'tis confeſs'd, that ſome do not ſay, that Baptiſm alone is the Door into the Church, but Baptiſm, and Impoſition of Hands. <q>There are two Doors to be paſſed through, (as ſaith a learned Writer) 'before we can come, <hi>aditus, &amp; intima Eccleſiae penetralia,</hi> viz. Baptiſm, and Laying on of Hands; whereof the latter properly and immediately gives admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</q> Mr. <hi>Hanmors</hi> cites ſome ancient Chriſtians ſpeaking thus, <hi>Confirmatio (ſive manuum impoſitio) protinus dat jus communicandi in Sacramento corporis ac ſanguinis Chriſti:</hi> That is, <q>Confirmation (or Impoſition of Hands) forthwith giveth full Authority and Right of Communion in the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</q> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ſaith the ſame Perſon, <q>He that was not confirmed, was not admitted to the Euchariſt.</q>
                              </p>
                           </cell>

A Maſter-Builder goes on with his Work, when the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is laid; the Scaffolds are not taken down, till the Building be finiſhed, but rather raiſed higher and higher, as the Fabrick goes up; he reſolves every Day's Work ſhall add ſome further Beauty to it, in order to the final perfecting of it.</cell>
                           <cell>X.

                     <head>Inferences.</head>
                     <p>ANd now to conclude with this Head, from the Whole we may infer theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars following:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That a true Miniſter of Chriſt, is one that is truly converted, a gracious, holy, and ſincere Perſon, one that hath the experience of the real Work of God upon his own Heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Member of a true conſtituted Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Community of godly Chriſtians, that have given up themſelves in a ſolemn Covenant, in the Fear of God, to walk in Fellowſhip and Communion together, according to the Rule of the Goſpel; amongſt whom the Word of God is truly preached, and the Ordinances duly and in a right manner adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he ought to be choſen by the Church, according to the Direction left by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, to 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, to 9.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That he ought to be a diſcreet Perſon, endued with conſiderable Gifts and Abilities by the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If called to be a Paſtor or Elder, he ought to be ordained by the laying on of hands of the Presbytery, or Elderſhip. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. That he ought to be very laborious, and give himſelf wholly to the Work of the Miniſtry; making the Word of God in all things his Rule.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That he ought to have a comfortable Maintenance allowed him by the Church, to which he belongs, if they are able to do it: That this is their Due by Divine Right, tho not a forced Maintenance, otherwiſe than Love to God, his Truth, and People, whoſe Duty forceth them to allow their Miniſters a Competency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> We may infer, That the Work of a Miniſter of Chriſt is no eaſy, but contrariwiſe a very hard and difficult Work: <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.16 Exod. 4.13 Jer. 20.9.</note> So hard, that many of Chriſt's Servants of old undertook it with much trembling, which made them cry out, <hi>Send by whom thou wilt ſend,</hi> &amp;c. So hard, that a Saint with all his natural Parts is not ſufficient for it; nay, a Saint with all his acquired Parts is not ſufficient for it; nay, I may ſay, a Saint with all his ſpiritual Gifts, Graces, and Endowments, without freſh Supplies of new Strength, is not ſufficient for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly;</hi> It informs us wherein the Difficulty of the Miniſters Work doth lie; and that,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In reſpect of themſelves, who are employed in it. (1.) They are but Men: <hi>Son of Man, I have made thee a Watchman;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.27.</note> and they commonly none of the wiſeſt and moſt learned in the eſteem of the World neither. (2.) Man at the beſt is a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Creature: <hi>We know but in part.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9 Rom. 7.</note> (3,) Man at beſt is attended with Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and carries a Body of Sin and Death about with him. (4.) Man at beſt hath but ſmall Skill, and ſhort Experience. (5.) Man at beſt is ſubject to great Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and liable to Temptations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In reſpect to the Work it ſelf, a Miniſter's Employment is very hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. (1.) 'Tis a myſterious Work; what Myſteries are greater than thoſe a Miniſter
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:39531:161"/> is to ſtudy and dive into?<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Without Controverſy, great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) 'Tis difficult, in that it calls for the greateſt Care and Exactneſs imaginable: <hi>Add not to his Word,</hi> &amp;c. (3.) In that it calls for the Strength of his whole Soul. (4.) In that it is a Work that conſiſteth in divers Parts; there are many Things in which a Miniſter ought to be well inſtructed, as appears by what hath been ſaid. (5.) In that it is a Work which calls for much Diligence; a ſlothful or idle Perſon is not fit to be a Miniſter. 'Tis a Work that muſt be followed continually: <hi>Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, exhort, with all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Tis a difficult Work, in reſpect of the Oppoſition that is made againſt them, or from thoſe grand Obſtructions they meet with, 1. From their own Hearts; 2. From Sin; 3. From Satan; 4. From the World, (1.) By Reproaches and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Ungodly; (2.) By Hereticks, and Falſe-Teachers; (3.) From Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly;</hi> We may infer from what hath been ſaid in opening theſe Metaphors, That Goſpel-Miniſtration is of abſolute Neceſſity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe God hath ordained Preaching as the ordinary Means for the Converſion of Sinners:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. God hath gifted, and graciouſly endowed ſome Men, on purpoſe for this Work.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He hath given plain Directions to his People, how and whom to chuſe and ordain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Neceſſity further appears, by conſidering the Nature of the Similes and Metaphors we have opened: Sinners are in Arms againſt God; and theſe are his Ambaſſadors, by whom he treats, and offers Terms of Peace to them. Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to eſpouſe Sinners to himſelf, and theſe are his Spokeſ-men, by whom he effects this glorious Enterprize.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly;</hi> It ſhews alſo, That the Miniſters Function is a moſt noble and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Employment; and that all due Reſpect, Eſteem, and Obedience ought to be given to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly;</hi> We may infer, That many who pretend themſelves to be Chriſt's true Miniſters, are none of his Miniſters, but rather a Shame and Reproach to that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name, Work, and Office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly;</hi> Let us learn from hence to bleſs God, that we have ſo many able and worthy Miniſters of Chriſt in our Land. O let us pray for them, and deſire God to ſend more of theſe Labourers into his Harveſt. <hi>Pray ye the Lord of the Harveſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly;</hi> It ſharply reproves many Churches and Profeſſors, for the great Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their Duties towards their Miniſters: What a Day do we live in! How is Chriſt's Intereſt, Miniſters, and poor Saints, forgot, ſlighted, and neglected! O that God would raiſe up ſome to <hi>cry aloud, and ſpare not, but lift up their Voice like a Trumpet, to ſhew God's People their Tranſgreſſions, and the Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>their Sins!</hi>

They ſtudy to find out the fitteſt Seaſon and Opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their Deſign, and Helliſh Purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> They watch for ſuch a Time, when the Profeſſors of the Goſpel and Truths of Jeſus begin to decline in their Zeal, and to loſe much of the Power of Godlineſs, and ſeem to make a mighty Stir about the Form thereof, and are much divided amongſt themſelves; when Iniquity doth abound, and the Love of many waxeth cold; in a word, when Men begin to grow ſecure, or the true Shepherd is off of his Watch, then theſe Wolves and Deceivers get abroad, and, like that wicked Enemy, ſow their Tares of Error and Deluſion. (5.) The Jeſuits, thoſe crafty Deceivers, have often appeared in a Diſguiſe externally, and do uſually change their Garbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes they are Holders-forth in a Quakers Meeting; at other times they will counterfeit themſelves to be Lawyers: Sometimes they will take on them the Habit of Prieſts, ſometimes Merchants, ſometimes Shoo-makers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this, that they may the more ſecurely carry on their wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes to pervert poor Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (6.) And laſtly, When theſe Falſe-Teachers and Deceivers begin to fear they ſhall be diſcovered, and perceive there is a Cry raiſed againſt them, and that they are cloſely purſued, and in danger to be taken, then (to ſave themſelves) they cry out againſt others. None are more ready to exclaim againſt Falſe-Teachers and Deceivers than they, endeavouring to caſt all the Infamy and black Aſperſions imaginable upon the true and faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, loading them with all the fouleſt Calumnies they can deviſe, that they themſelves may in the mean while paſs the better for true Men, and be the leſs ſuſpected. Thus thoſe blind Guides in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſerved our Saviour himſelf: <hi>Some ſaid, He is a good Man;</hi>

                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:39531:165"/>II. That it is the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, or Power of the <hi>Saracens;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſomewhat touches, and in a brief way moſt learnedly argues againſt, in his third Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 644, 645.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That it is indeed <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the fourth or laſt Empire, but <hi>Rome</hi> in its Heathen State, under the idolatrous and perſecuting Emperors: So the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> would have it, if there be a Neceſſity to fix upon <hi>Rome</hi> to be this <hi>Apocalyptical,</hi> or <hi>Myſtery Babylon.</hi> For this Opinion the preſent <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have no better Advocate than Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who hath done very worthily at other Turns. See his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the 17th Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That it is the preſent Power and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who under pretence of the moſt high and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, doth influence and govern the Secular Power and State of Kingdoms. Of this laſt Opinion were the ancient <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who felt the bloody Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> venting it ſelf in moſt horrid and barbarous Cruelties againſt them, and that for a long Series of Time, as appears by our moſt Authentick, Ancient, and Modern Writers, who give a very ample Account of the great Perſecution of Chriſtians, for many hundred Years laſt paſt, in all Parts of the Chriſtian World, where they have had Power. To which Opinion of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> moſt of our modern Proteſtant Divines agree, of which we ſhall mention only <hi>Cartwright, Fulk,</hi> the worthily admired, and Learned <hi>Mede,</hi> not forgetting famous <hi>Du Moulin</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> as may be ſeen in their Works at large.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we will not take Things upon Truſt, nor refer the Reader to many Quotations, which he may want Books and Time to ſatisfy himſelf about; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears needful, that we remove the Objections with as much Brevity as poſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſtate the Metaphor, and run the Parallel.</p>
                  <p>Now that <hi>Babylon</hi> in all theſe New-Teſtament Texts cannot be fairly applied to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> nor terminate in the Heatheniſh State of <hi>Rome,</hi> we offer theſe following Conſiderations or Arguments:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It cannot be meant the City <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did not reign over the Kings of the Earth in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, when he ſaw this Viſion, and wrote the Revelation, which this City <hi>Babylon</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid to do:<note place="margin">Rev. 17.18.</note> 
                     <hi>And the Woman which thou ſaweſt, is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth. Jeruſalem</hi> having been not only under Captivity divers times before, but were then entirely under the Power of the Roman Yoke, as the whole Hiſtory of the Goſpel doth confirm, and themſelves did moſt plainly confeſs: <hi>We have no King but</hi> Caeſar.<note place="margin">John 19.15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was never in ſo high eſteem with the Beaſt, as to be capable to ride as Queen-Regent upon him, (as this Woman, Whore, or City is ſaid to do): <hi>And the Angel ſaid unto me, Wherefore didſt thou marvel? I will tell thee the Myſtery of the Woman, and the Beaſt that carrieth her, which hath the ſeven Heads, and ten Horns.</hi> Rev. 17.7.<note place="margin">Rev. 17.7.</note> compared with Verſ. 3. <hi>So he carried me away in the Spirit into the Wilderneſs, and I ſaw a Woman ſit upon a Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, full of Names of Blaſphemy, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns,</hi> — For by the Woman ſitting, and Beaſt carrying, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſignified, Influence, Power, and Dominion, which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from, not only under the Roman Monarchy, but alſo under the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that went before it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Babylonian, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Perſian;</hi> as might be largely illuſtrated both out of Sacred and Humane Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did not ſit upon many Waters, which is interpreted to be People, Nations, and Tongues; that is, had not Command or Dominion over them, as this Woman,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.15.</note> Whore, or City is ſaid to have: <hi>And he ſaith, The Waters which thou ſaweſt, where the Whore ſitteth, are Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues:</hi> The whole Land of <hi>Judea</hi> being under Tribute to the Roman Government at that time: <hi>And it came to paſs in thoſe Days,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>that there went out a Decree from</hi> Caeſar Auguſtus, <hi>that all the World ſhould be taxed;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> and particularly, <hi>Galilee, Nazareth, Judea,</hi> and the City of <hi>David,</hi> called <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not capable to enchant and bewitch all the Nations round about her, either by her Religion and Doctrine, or by great Gifts and Rewards.</p>

                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:39531:165"/>(1.) Becauſe the Roman Power kept her under, and much in awe, on the one hand, not owning nor ſubſcribing to her Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Chriſtian Doctrine and Religion block'd up her Way, on the other hand, that ſhe could not extend her Influence to either neighbouring, or remote Nations, as this Woman, Whore, or City is ſaid to do: <hi>For thy Merchants were the great Men of the Earth; for by thy Sorceries were all Nations deceived.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 18.23</note>

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> tho ſhe were guilty of much Blood, from the beginning of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Glory, in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Time, killing Prophets, even all that were ſent unto her, murthered <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and our Lord and Saviour, as alſo the bleſſed Martyr, St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> yet in her could not be found that great Maſs of Blood that was ſhed, and Myriads of Chriſtian Saints that have been barbarouſly murthered, by Maſſacre, and publick Martyrdom, ſince they were ruined and deſtroyed by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi> which we find poſitively charged upon this City <hi>Babylon:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. And laſtly; Not to multiply more upon this Head, tho <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſtroyed, as the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhews; yet ſhall ſhe riſe again, be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her own Heap, be repleniſhed with her own Children, which this City <hi>Babylon</hi> under Conſideration ſhall never be, after this Cataſtrophe which <hi>John</hi> ſaw viſionally coming upon it: <hi>And a mighty Angel took up a Stone, like a great Mill-ſtone,</hi>

                     <hi>and caſt it into the Sea, ſaying, Thus with violence ſhall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. It cannot be the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> for two Reaſons offered by the Learned <hi>Mead,</hi> lib. 3. p. 643.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe tho they did ariſe to great Power in the World, yet they had not their Seat in that great City, which in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Time reigned over the Kings of the Earth, which this <hi>Babylon</hi> is expreſly ſaid to have.<note place="margin">Rev. 17.18.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they did not riſe by Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Religion, which this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> (with her Head, the Man of Sin) did; for, as this worthy Author ſaith, the <hi>Turk</hi> (whatever he be) could be no Apoſtate, becauſe he was of a Nation that never was Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>To which we ſhall add ſomething for the clearing of this Head, that we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that Debt we owe to God, to the Church, and the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It cannot be the <hi>Turks,</hi> becauſe they are not ſtrangely and wonderfully myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, which this <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſaid to be: <hi>And upon her Forehead was a Name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOTS,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 17.5.</note> 
                     <hi>AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And the Angel ſaid unto me, Wherefore didſt thou marvel? I will tell thee the Myſtery of the Woman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Beaſt which carrieth her, which hath the ſeven Heads, and ten Horns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſpecial Myſtery hath ſhewed it ſelf to the World from the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> more than from other common Empires or Kingdoms, that is matter of Admiration to the wiſeſt of Men? Is it matter of Wonder, that the <hi>Turks</hi> do own but one true, and moſt high God? Is it matter of Wonder, that they do own Jeſus Chriſt to be a Prophet, and a good Man? Is it matter of higheſt Wonder, that they prefer <hi>Mahomet</hi> above <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Is it matter of Wonder, that they appear true to their Contracts, in Matters of Civil Commerce? Is it matter of higheſt Wonder, for them to endeavour to keep what Dominion they have, and to enlarge it, to make Slaves and Prizes of thoſe profeſt Enemies they take Priſoners? We ſay, in none of theſe things is there any high My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, or matter of greateſt Wonder, being Things common to all Places and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms inveſted with Power: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Did not the great King of Literal <hi>Babylon</hi> own the only true God, yet ſtill held the Church in Captivity?</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Did not <hi>Iſrael</hi> own the ſame, and yet kept their Idols, after their Revolt from <hi>Judah?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Did not <hi>Judah</hi> prefer <hi>Moſes</hi> above and before Chriſt, and at that time when Chriſt was perſonally amongſt them, working moſt ſtupendous Miracles, which did evince his Divine Miſſion? Nay, did they not prefer a common and notorious Villain before the bleſſed Lord of Glory, when they deſired a Murtherer to be freed, and preſſed hard to have the good and bleſſed Jeſus, the Saviour of the World, killed? And did not this wiſe Apoſtle know this to be true in Fact, and to equal, nay, out-do
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:39531:166"/> any thing that the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Saracens</hi> ever did, or can be accuſed of? And if St. <hi>John</hi> was tranſported with aſtoniſhing Wonder, at Matters much leſs than he had ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth it not give good reaſon to ſuſpect him of Weakneſs and Defect, that he ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be ſurprized with the greateſt Wonder, at far leſs Things than he had ſeen and known before? Certainly therefore we muſt conclude, there was ſomething more of Myſtery in <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion, than what hath been ſhewed to the World by the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> or any other Power; and indeed, undoubtedly, the greateſt My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery that ever the World was acquainted with: For the Characters of <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſingular, that is, ſuch as none have beſides; or elſe they muſt be tranſcendent, to go far beyond what others had in a leſſer degree.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt;</hi> That ſhe doth tranſact the moſt horrid Wickedneſſes that ever the World was, or is like to be, acquainted with.</p>

                  <p n="1">(1.) That a Shepherd ſhould be a Wolf, and devour that Flock which he pretends to be an Overſeer or Paſtor of.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That a profeſſed Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, and the meaneſt of Saints, ſhould exalt himſelf above his Maſter, and not above his Maſter only, but above the God of his Maſter, and all other deputed Gods, that are Vicegerents to the King of Heaven, by ſlighting and trampling upon the Holy Scriptures, and Laws both of God and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, diſpenſing with the Breach of them, indulging the higheſt Violation thereof, and ſetting up his own Inventions, Traditions, and Decrees above them; inſomuch that there is a thouſand times leſs danger (in their eſteem) in reſpect of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, and Corporal Puniſhments in this World, or of Damnation in the World to come, in breaking and violating the Laws of God and Princes, than there is in the Violation or Breach of the Inventions, Traditions, and Decrees of Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> and her Head.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) That one ſitting in the Temple of God, pretending himſelf as a poor Apoſtle, Vicar, and Succeſſor of Chriſt, nay, as the Succeſſor of a poor Fiſherman, ſhould wear the higheſt Enſigns of Imperial Dignity!</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) That he ſhould be ſo lordly, and prodigiouſly inſolent, (who was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the greateſt Humility and Abaſement) as to tread upon the Necks of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, kick off the Crowns of great Princes, and make Kings his Foot-Pages.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) That he ſhould pretend highly, yea, moſt highly, to God, Chriſt, Religion, and Holineſs, and yet eſpouſe to himſelf, as the Darlings of his Boſom, not only the chiefeſt Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> but all that will decline Sanctity and Religion, and embody themſelves with thoſe Firſt-born Sons of Wickedneſs, that are of the higheſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and engage themſelves in ſuch monſtrous and butcherly Practices, that humane Nature, as ſuch, could never act in the butchering of brute Beaſts.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) That the Spouſe of this prodigious Monſter ſhould in Profeſſion own God, Jeſus Chriſt, and the Things of Religion, of which Juſtice and Charity, Holineſs and Compaſſion are not the leaſt Part; and yet under this Vizard, and in the very time of theſe Pretenſions, perpetrate the greateſt and moſt unparallel'd Villanies in the World: 1. In being the Top of Pride. 2. In committing palpable Idolatry. 3. Fill themſelves with Exceſs and Drunkenneſs. 4. To curſe, ſwear, and blaſpheme the very Name they profeſs to be ſacred. 5. To caſt down the Truth, burn the Bible, deface the holy Books and Laws of God. 6. To aſſume not only a Power to diſpenſe with Violations of the higheſt Nature, but to pardon and forgive them at pleaſure. 7. To commit Adultery, and account it a venial Crime. 8. To break Covenants, drive a Trade in Perjury, forſwear every thing they are juſtly charged with, and is fully proved againſt them. 9. To foment Wars and Broils in every Kingdom and Country where they have Power; contrive the Ruine of Towns and Places, Cities, Countries, and Kingdoms, by Fire, Sword, and moſt cruel Devaſtations. 10. To ſlaughter, kill, and barbarouſly murther, both Men, Women, and Children, even all that dare make a ſhew of Conſcience and Religion, ſo far as to abhor and diſſent from theſe Villanies.</p>

                  <p>This is ſuch a Scheme of Religion, and Syſteme of Divinity, to come from an Apoſtle, a Shepherd, a Vicar and Succeſſor of Chriſt, from a Church, Sheep, Saints, and the pretended Followers of the meek, peaceable, and innocent Jeſus, who taught altogether otherwiſe by his Doctrine and Example, that it might well be wondred at, and is the ſtrangeſt Myſtery that ever appeared, of which we challenge the whole World to ſhew the like in the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens.</hi> For Men to ſwear, lie, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear themſelves, and yet be true Men: to contrive Rebellion, Murther, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and yet be as innocent as the Child unborn: to be elevated to the higheſt Pinacle of Pride, even above Emperors and Kings, above Jeſus Chriſt, and God his Father; and yet be humble and lowly: To commit groſs Idolatry; and yet be the Servants of the Living God: To be filled with, and make a Trade of Exceſs and Drunkenneſs; and yet be the Paterns and Standards of Sobriety and Temperance: To caſt down the Truth to the Ground, deface the Laws of God, and burn the Scriptures; and yet be the true Witneſſes to it: To forgive Sins, and yet be the greateſt of Sinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: To commit Fornication and Adultery; and yet be ſpotleſs and pure in Heart; To foment Wars and Broils in every Kingdom and Country where they have Power; to contrive the Ruine of Towns and Places, Cities, Countries, and Kingdoms, by Fire, Sword, and cruel Devaſtations; and yet be as harmleſs as Doves to all Mankind, the only Sons of Peace and Quietneſs: To ſlaughter, kill, and barbarouſly murther Men, Women, and Children, that dare not be ſo wicked as themſelves; and yet to be full of Mercy, tender Pity, and Compaſſion; an Apoſtle, Shepherd, Vicar, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of the meek and Lamb-like Saviour. And for the dear Conſort of this impious Head, or Man of Sin, to be not only confederate with him, but a Principal in all theſe unparallel'd Villanies, and moſt butcherly and rapacious Murthers; and yet be the Holy Catholick Church of God, the pure and ſpotleſs Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, the true Sheep, the harmleſs Lambs, the beſt of Saints, and cloſe Followers of the Lord Jeſus, who always taught the contrary by his holy Doctrine, and meek Example. We ſay, theſe Things not being found by ſecret Search, but are written in Capital Letters upon her Forehead, appear in open view, to be read by every one that is not wilfully blind: Let any one ſhew us a greater Myſtery in the World than this, and we will ſubſcribe to it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It cannot be the <hi>Turks,</hi> becauſe they are not the Mother of Harlots, and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Earth, which this <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſaid to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5. <hi>And upon her Forehead was a Name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</hi> And here we demand, in excuſe to the <hi>Turks,</hi> this one Thing:</p>
                  <p>From whence did proceed the Murthers, Maſſacres, and Martyrdoms of all the Religious Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, that have died by violence in the Chriſtian World, for the ſpace of twelve hundred Years laſt paſt? And from what People did proceed thoſe horrid Oaths, Blaſphemies, and Execrations, that the World hath wofully been acquainted with, moſt horrid and ſtrangely aſtoniſhing to repeat?</p>
                  <p>Came theſe unparallel'd Degrees of Impiety from the <hi>Turks?</hi> from the <hi>Waldenſians, Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> or any <hi>Non-conforming Proteſtants?</hi> No, no. Why, whoſe Language then is it? Whoſe! Why, 'tis the Language of the Beaſt of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit, and bloody Whore, who bare theſe blaſphemous Sons of her own Body, daily nouriſhes them at her Breaſt, and ſtrengthens them in their ſinful Courſes, by accounting them the Sons, the precious Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> the true Sons of the Catholick Church, the Darlings of Heaven, the beloved Ones of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and giving them Pardons for theſe bold and Heaven-daring Sins, as often as they do commit them, and come to ask Pardon for them; ſo that Sin and Pardon is as conſtant and common with them, as Breathing and Eating. And theſe Things are done to ſeal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Lies, which is the more heavy, heinous, and prodigious: For if Men may lie by allowance; may kill, and ſhed innocent Blood, without Controul of Conſcience, and Church-Cenſures; may ſwear and blaſpheme, and challenge God himſelf to damn them; may burn Men for Religion, conſume Cities to Aſhes, conſpire the Death of Kings, the Ruine and Overthrow of Kingdoms, whore, and murther Infants; and yet be accounted a Church, the Members and Parts of it, called Saints, holy Children, and Sons of the Moſt High God: Then may we claim a Patent, and take a Licenſe to change the Name of all Things, and alter all the Idea's of the Minds of Men; call and account <hi>Beelzebub</hi> a good God, and all his black Tribe, the pure Saints of the Moſt High; call the lower Regions of Blackneſs and Darkneſs, to which he is confin'd,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:39531:167"/> the Heaven of Glory and eternal Light. Of which Things we ought in Juſtice to clear the <hi>Turks,</hi> until Witneſſes of undoubted Credit ſhall come forth, and evidence, that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> State is the Mother of as great Abominations as theſe are.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And laſtly; The <hi>Turks</hi> cannot be Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe they never were made drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus, which this Woman, Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.6. <hi>And I ſaw the Woman drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus; and I wondred with great admiration.</hi> Now let any Man ſhew ſuch Bloodſhed, Saints Bloodſhed, by Maſſacres and Martyrdom, for the profeſſing of Chriſtianity, (which muſt be, if the Text be anſwered in that Clauſe, <hi>Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus,</hi>) by the <hi>Turks,</hi> either within their Dominions, or without, as hath been ſhed by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration nearer home, and we ſhall become like the Man without a Wedding-Garment, wholly ſpeechleſs, and ſay not a Word more about <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Now that <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> is Great <hi>Rome,</hi> that in former Times reigned, and in future Times ſhall be deſtroyed, is owned by ſome of the Papiſts themſelves, and is aſſerted by all Proteſtants; the Difference betwixt them is brought to this narrow Point. The one wholly confines <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, and there totally to terminate; the other brings <hi>Babylon</hi> down lower, to <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or Papal <hi>Rome.</hi> Now that this Work may be to Edification, and more full Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this great Caſe, we ſhall advance to the laſt and chief Secret that is to be opened and conſidered, namely, Whether all Things in <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion or Prophecy, that are applied to Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> did compleatly terminate in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, and come no further?</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this great Enquiry, we do, with the Body of Proteſtants, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Papiſts, conclude the Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Things in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> applied to Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> did not terminate in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen. The Reaſons of which Negative are as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Beaſt that Myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> rides on, is the eighth Head, or laſt Ruling-Power of that City that is ſeated upon ſeven Hills, which muſt be <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole Race of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen was gone off, before the eighth Head came up. — The ſixth Head was in <hi>John</hi>'s Time; the ſeventh was to come, and continue but a ſhort Space, <hi>The Beaſt that carrier the Woman,</hi> viz. Babylon, <hi>is of the ſeventh, but is the eighth, and ſhall be the laſt; for he goeth into Perdition.</hi> This being ſo evident from the Letter of the Text, needs nothing more to confirm it. Now that <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen was not the laſt Part of the Romiſh Power, is not only the full and joint Conſent of all Writers upon this Subject, but is ſo evident to all the Chriſtian World, that it would be Vanity it ſelf to make a Show of Proof. The Concluſion then is this: If the very laſt Part of the Roman Power carries the Woman <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that the Heathen State of <hi>Rome</hi> went off before, and was not the laſt; then <hi>Babylon</hi> could not terminate in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, but muſt come down to <hi>Rome</hi> Papal. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3, 7, 9, 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If <hi>Babylon</hi> be totally terminated in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, then the Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> is of little uſe to the latter Ages of the Chriſtian World: For if the whole Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons relating to the Perſecution of the Church, and the Slaughter and Deſtruction of God's Enemies, did end in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, then it ſerved only to give a characteriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Account of a Beaſt and Whore that was grown old, and ready to go off the Stage; but hath wholly left us in the dark, and given us no notice at all of that horrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and bloody Perſecutions, which have reigned in the Chriſtian World for more than a thouſand Years laſt paſt; which for Length of Time, Numbers of Murthers, and Manner of Cruelties, hath out-done all the Wickedneſs of <hi>Rome</hi> in its Heathen State. Which is not at all likely, that a Viſion ſhould be given, and a Revelation made, and call'd ſo, about a State that was almoſt expired, and the moſt great and principal Part wholly left out, and ſaid nothing to. Who can imagine, that a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Saviour ſhould be ſo full in his Diſcoveries to the Jewiſh Church, concerning their Sufferings, and the Time under <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> Literal; and be ſo ſhort and lean to his Goſpel-Church, to leave them altogether without any written Profpect, or extraordinary Prophet, to inform them what ſhould come to paſs in the World, from the going off of the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, to the end of all the Churches Troubles, which have already laſted above a thouſand Years? The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of which is fit but for two Ranks of Men to receive, <hi>viz.</hi> the Roman-Catholicks, and ſuch Proteſtants as look for Antichriſt to come at the end of the World, after the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:39531:167"/> Reſtauration of the Jews to their own Land, and building a material Temple at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> where Antichriſt ſhall ſit three Days and an half, or Years, to kill two Men called the two Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If this laſt <hi>Babylon</hi> was wholly to terminate in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, then there was no Cauſe of Wonderment and great Admiration for a wiſe Man, to ſee in a Viſion an Heatheniſh State, under a Diabolical Influence, to perform Actions ſutable to their State, and not contrary to their Profeſſions: For what matter of Wonderment can it be to feel the Wind blow, to ſee the Sea foam, and hear the Waves rage and roar, when the Winds oppoſe its Effluxion? And what Cauſe of great Wonderment and Admiration for a wiſe Man, to ſee wicked Heathens oppoſe and perſecute Chriſtianity, when it is ſo ſutable to their Spirit, and agreeable to their Profeſſion ſo to do, we cannot yet underſtand, and we will diligently liſten to them who will undertake to inform us: For the thing is true, that a wiſe Man did wonder at the Sight he ſaw with great Admiration, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.6. <hi>I ſaw the Woman drunk with the Blood of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Jeſus, and I wondred with great admiration.</hi> Wonder'd! O ſtrange! At what? To ſee that which was common to all Ages, the Seed of the Serpent, that profeſt Heatheniſm, the Wicked, even the worſt of the Wicked, by Principle and Profeſſion, to plot againſt the Righteous, and to gnaſh upon him with their Teeth; Idolaters, profeſt Idolaters, to perſecute the Servants and Worſhippers of the true God; thoſe that were born after the Fleſh, and lived after the Fleſh, to perſecute them that were born of the Spirit, and lived after the Spirit. Surely, if our Adverſaries Opinion was true in this Caſe, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is only <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, St. <hi>John</hi> had forgot that <hi>Cain</hi> killed <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> perſecuted <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and took not ſo much notice of the Courſe of the World, common to every Age, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, who ſaid, <hi>But as he that was born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit;</hi> as it was then, ſo it is now: And what ſtrange Wonder is in all this?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen never was eſpouſed, married, or united to the Lord Jeſus, in a ſpiritual way, viſibly owning his Laws, and ſubmitting to his Government, as a Wife ſubmits to, and obeys her Husband, and afterwards caſts him off, and chuſes another Head and Husband; and therefore cannot be Myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the great Whore: For tho theſe Heathens were great Idolaters, yet were they never charged with ſpiritual Adultery, nor could they, unleſs they had once, by viſible Profeſſion, made a Covenant with, or eſpouſed themſelves to the Lord Jeſus, which <hi>Rome</hi> Papal before its Apoſtacy did: Therefore <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen could not be the great Whore, or Myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen cannot be the <hi>Babylon</hi> ſet forth by St. <hi>John,</hi> unleſs ſhe be guilty of all the Chriſtian Blood ſhed upon the Earth ſince the Deſtruction o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that if we will regard the full ſatisfying of this Prediction about My<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen cannot be this <hi>Babylon</hi> under Conſideration, becauſe the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of other Prophecies, relating to the ſame State, no way agrees to the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) This State of <hi>Babylon</hi> is called the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity.</hi> This no way agrees to <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, but fully agrees to <hi>Rome</hi> Papal.

                  <p n="10">(10.) This Myſtery of Iniquity is not only ſaid to come <hi>after the working of Satan,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9. but alſo <hi>with All Power,</hi> &amp;c. But the Riſe of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen was not after that manner: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. To illuſtrate the firſt Propoſition, note, That the Term <hi>[All Power]</hi> marks out the Romiſh Pope ſo notoriouſly, that whoſoever runs may read it; for if we do but impartially conſider his impudent Uſurpations upon Crowned Heads, and his Pretences of Supremacy over the whole Chriſtian World;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:39531:168"/> his proud imperious Decrees, Bulls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Diſpoſal of the Kingdoms of Princes, and the Inheritances, yea, the very Lives of private Perſons, of any Rank, that dare diſobey him; his Pretences to ſhut and open Heaven, Hell, and his feigned Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; his carrying a Symbol of that vaſt and God-like Power, <hi>viz.</hi> a Brace of Keys hanging at his Girdle: All theſe will appear as clear Demonſtrations, that the Head of <hi>Rome</hi> Papal is the Head of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Grand Impoſtor, or the Capital Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this Myſtery of Iniquity, he having (moſt ſacrilegiouſly) aſſumed to himſelf all Heavenly Power of damning or ſaving, and all Earthly Power, both Temporal or Civil, and Eccleſiaſtical or Sacred.</p>
                  <p n="11">(11.) This wicked <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> State comes forth with a great Pretence of Miracles, which are but falſe Signs, and lying Wonders, to deceive and cheat the People; and by this means they conquer Nations, and carry away their Kings to their wicked Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. This <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen did not do. For tho the Heatheniſh Power of <hi>Rome</hi> did conquer Nations and Countries, with their Kings, yet it was by State-Policy, and Force of Arms, not by pretended Miracles, falſe Signs, and lying Wonders: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen cannot be this Myſtery of Iniquity, or <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> State.</p>
                  <p n="12">(12.) This wicked State, under conſideration, is declared not only to depart from the Faith by a palpable Apoſtacy, but to forbid Marriage, and command a long Lent, and many other Faſt-Days, whereon ſome Sorts of Meats are prohibited to be eaten; which doth ſo fully agree to the Papal State of <hi>Rome,</hi> that nothing can be more plain, unleſs the Spirit had expreſly told us, This will be fulfilled by <hi>Rome</hi> Papal. For theſe two things we have their Canons upon Record, the which if none can ſhew the like of the Heathen State of <hi>Rome,</hi> then <hi>Rome</hi> Papal ſhall carry the Title of this Myſtery of Iniquity, and <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> State.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If the <hi>Babylon,</hi> under conſideration, be only confined to the Power of Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> then there is a more evident and apparent Myſtery upon the State or Power of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, than upon any Power or State that went before it, or ſhould come after it; for ſo the Text imports, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5. <hi>And upon her Forehead was a Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,</hi> &amp;c. But there did no ſuch Myſtery appear upon the Power or State of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, therefore this <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot terminate there. What great Myſtery appeared upon the Power and State of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, more than appeared upon the Power and State of the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Monarchies?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot be confined to the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> only in its Heathen State, becauſe <hi>Babylon</hi> is to continue till the good People ſhall (with the Horns that did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her, which is the laſt Part of the wicked and perſecuting Power, anſwerable to the ten Toes in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s great Image) reward and deſtroy her, for the Injury that ſhe did unto them, according to theſe three Texts of Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.22, 26, 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16. <hi>And I heard another Voice from Heaven, ſaying, Come out of her, my People, that ye be not Partak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the ten Horns which thou ſaweſt upon the Beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the Whore, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eat her Fleſh, and burn her with Fire:</hi> Which the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> in its Heathen State felt not, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded its Courſe, without being deſtroyed by good People, and the ten Horns, which is the laſt Part of the Image-Government. <hi>And in the Days of theſe Kings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 2.44.</note> (viz. ten Toes, ten Horns, ten Kings) <hi>ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdom which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be deſtroyed: And the Kingdom ſhall not be left to another People, but it ſhall break in pieces and conſume all theſe Kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Which could not be fulfilled in what <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did in the Time of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> would have us believe, for theſe three Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe the ten Horns, that afterwards the Roman Power fell into, were not come up, and ſo could not deſtroy the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> in its Heathen State.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Perſecution, Miſery, and Confuſion, did not utterly ceaſe, which it muſt have done, ſo as to riſe no more for ever, if the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen deſtroyed by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> had been this Myſtery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Becauſe tho there might be a Body of good People with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when he overthrew <hi>Maxentius,</hi> yet the Power of the Kingdom was not ſo eſtabliſhed in the hand of good People, as not afterward to be left to others, as the Text affirms; <hi>And the Kingdom ſhall not be left to another People:</hi> For (as we ſhall anon ſhew) the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Power that ceaſed to be in the hands of Heathens, and by a mighty and divine
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:39531:169"/> Providence came to be in the hands of a worthy and renowned Chriſtian Emperor, came afterwards into the hands of very Devils incarnate, who acted all the Violence of the Heathen Power over again, and indeed out-did them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thoſe that are for confining this <hi>Babylon</hi> to the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> in its Heathen State, are not well aware what they do; for if they do demand it, their Oppoſites, who hold it to be <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, may grant it for Argument's ſake: But then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is worſe than the Diſeaſe; for they ſlip into ſuch a Precipice, as neither <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Bellarmine,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> or the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> can ſave or deliver them from. The true State of the Caſe is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen is Myſtery <hi>Babylon;</hi> this ſay the Papiſts: And the more willing they are to ſay ſo, becauſe it is a good Argument to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing his firſt Epiſtle from <hi>Babylon,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.13. <hi>The Church that is at</hi> Babylon, <hi>elected together with you, ſaluteth you,</hi> &amp;c. But this being allowed, the worſt is to come. This <hi>Babylon</hi> is deſtroyed, when the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen is taken away, ſo as to be no more for ever; but then what Condition doth the State of <hi>Babylon</hi> fall into? Doth it become the Throne of the Lamb, the City of the Living God, the Habitation of Holineſs, and Dwelling-place of <hi>Zion,</hi> the true Church, the Place of the holy Ones, and Saints of the Moſt High? O no! What then? Hearken, and an Angel from Heaven ſhall tell you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.1, 2. <hi>And after theſe Things</hi> (of the Horns ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Whore, making of her naked, and burning her Fleſh with Fire) <hi>I ſaw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel come down from Heaven, having great Power, and the Earth was lightned with his Glory; and he cried mightily, with a ſtrong Voice, ſaying,</hi> Babylon <hi>the Great is fallen, is fallen; and is become the Habitation of Devils, and the Hold of every foul Spirit, and a Cage of every unclean and hateful Bird.</hi> Now, you Papiſts, if you will needs have <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> to be <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, take it, and much Good do you with it; but then make <hi>Rome</hi> Papal better than an Habitation of Devils, if you can.</p>
                  <p>If it be not <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, then adieu to Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> we have what we deſire: If it be, then <hi>Rome</hi> Papal is a far worſe Place than <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen or <hi>Babylon</hi> ever was; — And then what a fine Church do the People make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If the Place, Seat, and City of <hi>Rome</hi> was not utterly ruined, (ſo as to be no more for ever as a Place of Commerce, Trade, and Human Society,) when the Heathen Power ceaſed, — then <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen cannot be this <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe at the Ending and Downfall of this <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Place, Seat, and City is utterly ruined, ſo as to be no more a Place of Trade,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.16.</note> Commerce, or human Society: <hi>And the ten Horns which thou ſaweſt upon the Beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the Whore, and ſhall make her deſolate, and ſhall eat her Fleſh, and burn her with Fire.</hi> Verſe 18. <hi>And the Woman which thou ſaweſt is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth — for her Sins which God hath remembred,</hi>

                     <hi>which have reached unto Heaven, therefore ſhall her Plagues come in one Day, Death, and Mourning, and Famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with Fire: For ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</hi> Ver. 11, 12, 13. All Sorts of Merchandize, Traffick, Trade, and Commerce with humane Society, ſhall ceaſe, ſo as to be no more in her at all; and the good Things which ſhe in Fulneſs enjoyed before, even all Things that were dainty and goodly, are now departed from her, and ſhe ſhall find them no more at all, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. for in one Hour is ſhe made deſolate. <hi>And a mighty Angel took up a Stone, like a great Mill-ſtone, and caſt it into the Sea, ſaying, Thus with Violence ſhall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all.</hi> Verſe 21. <hi>And the Voice of Harpers, and Muſicians, and of Pipers, and Trumpeters, ſhall be heard no more at all in thee; and no Craftſman, of whatſoever Craft he be, ſhall be found any more in thee; and the Sound of a Mill-ſtone ſhall be heard no more at all in thee.</hi> Verſe 22. <hi>And the Light of the Candle ſhall ſhine no more at all in thee; and the Voice of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, and of the Bride, ſhall be heard no more at all in thee.</hi> Verſe 23.</p>
                  <p>But the Place, Seat, and City of <hi>Rome</hi> was not ſo utterly ruined as to be no more for ever a Place of Trade, Traffick, Merchandize, and humane Society, when the Heathen Power of <hi>Rome</hi> ended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo, Rome</hi> Heathen cannot be the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> under preſent Conſideration, whoſe Seat or City hath ſince had a powerful Government, reigning in Pride and Pomp, for ſome hundreds of Years.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If <hi>Rome</hi> Papal be Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> the City of Pride and Confuſion, that is ſet forth by St. <hi>Jobn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> then neither the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> nor <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, is or can be the ſame: But <hi>Rome</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal is the Myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> ſet forth by St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe — Ergo</hi> neither the

                  <p>The laſt Propoſition is thus proved:</p>
                  <p>If all the Marks and Characters left us upon Divine Record, to prove Myſtery <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> by, do more aptly and fitly agree to <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, than to the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen: Then <hi>Rome</hi> Papal; and not any one of them, is Myſtery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Marks and Characters left upon Divine Record, to diſtinguiſh and know Myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> by, do more aptly and fitly agree to <hi>Rome</hi> Papal:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo, Rome</hi> Papal, and not the other, is Myſtery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the clearing up of this Argument, we ſhall diſtinctly ſtate the Character of Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> and run the Parallel betwixt her and <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, in this Method following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Babylon</hi> is a Woman, which imports either a ſingle Perſon, rank'd in the Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Gender; or a Body of People related to ſome Head, Husband, or publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom ſhe is joined in Wedlock, by Covenant, or Matrimonial Contract, as <hi>Eve</hi> was related to <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore called Woman; or as <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were joined in Covenant with God, and therefore called a Woman; or as the true Church now is married or joined to Chriſt, and therefore called a Woman. A ſingle Perſon, as <hi>Eve</hi> was, ſhe cannot be, becauſe the Character given of her in reſpect of her State and Actions, doth no way comport with it: She muſt therefore be a Body of People, related to ſome Head, Husband, or publick Perſon, as <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old was, who are often called by the Title of Woman; and in like manner <hi>Babylon,</hi> before her Degeneracy, were a People joined in Matrimonial Contract, by a Goſpel-Covenant and Profeſſion, to the Son of God.</p>

                              <p n="2">2. Great in Power.

                              <p>To reinforce this Argument, let it be conſidered that the Chriſtian World is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed or divided into two Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Papiſts and Proteſtants; the Proteſtants cannot be this Whore.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Becauſe they own Jeſus Chriſt to be Head of the Church, and only him.</p>

When this human, ſinful, and wicked Head, is called our Lord God the Pope, whether this is not Blaſphemy againſt God? (2.) When he is called, Univerſal Head of the Catholick Church, which none is but Chriſt. (3.) When he is called the Lamb of God, the Light of the World, the Root of <hi>David,</hi> the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> whether this is not Blaſphemy againſt the Son of God? (4.) Whether when the Orders of the Church, Oral Tradition, the Decrees of Councils, are ſaid to be of greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than the Scriptures, which they call a Noſe of Wax, the Hereticks Ink-Rule, are perniciouſly miſchievous to the People; whether this be not Blaſphemy againſt God that ſpake, and the Word of God ſpoken? (5.) When Angels, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other unknown Saints, ſhall be invocated with Addreſſes only becoming the Divine Majeſty; as if theſe Creatures were infinite, and could hear us at ſo great a diſtance as is Earth from Heaven, which they could not do, if perpendicularly over us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much leſs from all parts of the World, over which they cannot be; whether this aſcribing Infiniteneſs and Adoration to the Creature, that is only due to the Creator, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever, be not Blaſphemy? (6.) To conclude, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther making a God of a piece of Bread, and calling the prophane Prieſt the Maker of the Creature, be not aſcribing that to the Creature, which only belongs to God? Is not this the vileſt Blaſphemy in the World, worſe (if poſſible) than Atheiſm it ſelf?

Now if it be calculated for the Chriſtian World, then it muſt be upon ſuch a People, that is moſt publick and viſible, and apparent, which agrees to none ſo fitly as to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> which, by their own Confeſſion, is the moſt potent and viſible in the Chriſtian World, for where have the inconſiderable Hereticks (ſo called) whoſe Beings are in Corners, ſuch a <hi>Name,</hi> as may be read or known by all, or the principal part of the Chriſtian World? Now to clear theſe poor innocent (ſo called Hereticks, from being concerned in this Character, we imagine at leaſt it cannot refer to them:</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Becauſe they have no Forehead ſo broad to bear the Inſcription, which we will engage to make good againſt any <hi>Romaniſt</hi> in the World.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are ſo plain and honeſt a People, and their Principles ſo eaſily and well known, that it is wild and ridiculous to call them Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> there neither being any helliſh depth nor confuſion in what they profeſs, as might be fully evinced by unqueſtionable Inſtances; for what confuſion or hidden thing can be in this, that there is one God the Object of Worſhip, one Holy Book called the Bible, the Rule of Worſhip, one bleſſed Kingdom, Heaven, or World to come, the Reward of Worſhip; and all that act Faith, Hope and Charity, upon theſe three great Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſhall inherit that bleſſed Kingdom, or World to come?</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Becauſe they are ſo retired and private, that had they a Forehead broad enough for the Inſcription aforeſaid, yet they ſit ſo low that Nations cannot eaſily read it; and if we acquit the poor innocent Proteſtants, who muſt we fix theſe Characters upon? If all Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be clear, then it muſt unavoidably be fixed upon <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf: if any demand for what Reaſon, the Anſwer is,</p>
                              <p>Firſt, Becauſe when the Proteſtants are exempted, then there is none left to bear the Inſcription, but the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">2. She hath a Forehead broad enough to bear Myſtery and Confuſion, for there is not a greater helliſh depth and Confuſion to be found upon any People, than upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as will appear in its place.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Diſſenters, with reſpect to Appearance, and the exerciſe of Power, are very ſmall and inconſiderable, in compariſon of that overgrown monſtrous Body of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for to call the Diſſenters great, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſmall, is as congruous, as to call the Ocean a little Spring, and the ſmalleſt Brook the Ocean.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, <hi>Babylon,</hi> Confuſion, or a mixt Body, is far from that pure Order, which in Words <hi>Rome</hi> pretends unto, and can by no means agree to the Proteſtants; for they are ſo ſtrict in their Diſcipline, that they admit of no ſuch mixture that deſerves the Name of Confuſion, they will receive none into their Communion without much Caution and Satisfaction; and when received, keep them no longer than they appear to walk ſtrictly and holily, according to the Principles upon which they firſt received them; and as for their Officers they are ſoon ſummed up, being no more than Biſhops, or Elders, and Deacons. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church may be called <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the City
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:39531:175"/> of Confuſion very reaſonably, becauſe ſhe ſo fitly anſwers literal <hi>Babylon</hi> of old, that was her Type, and from whence ſhe derives her Name.</p>

                              <p n="3">3. In bearing the Glory and Sway over the Kingdoms and Countries of the chiefeſt part of the World, therefore called the Lady of Kingdoms, which is no way applicable to the poor Diſſenters.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. In plucking up, or razing out the true Worſhip of God, which was ſetled at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and ſetting up Idolatry in the room of it.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. In Captivating God's People, who were carried away into literal <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="6">6. In their Doctrines, Principles, and Modes of Worſhip, which is ſuch a jumble, mixture, and heap of Things, that may go for Confuſion it ſelf.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. In their Orders, Diverſity, and long Muſter-Roll of Officers, that are ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as well as unſcriptural, that if Mixture and Confuſion may be thought to be any where, 'tis to be found in this Church, where you have, Popes, Cardinals, Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Abbots, Provincials, Heads of Fraternities, Prieſts, Monks, Fryers, Followers of <hi>Dominick,</hi> St. <hi>Francis, Janſenius, Auguſtine, Caphucins, &amp;c.</hi> and what not? All which is many times more like to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> Mixture, or Confuſion, than the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, For <hi>[Myſtery]</hi> which is in the Deſcription, it no where agrees to them, whom they call Hereticks, but agrees very well to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in four Things.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. In calling themſelves the Church of God, and yet are the Synagogue of Satan, that's a Myſtery.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. In calling themſelves the pure Spouſe of Chriſt, and yet an abominable Whore; that's a Myſtery.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. In pretending to be the Mother of Peace, Purity, and Charity, and yet the Breeder, Bringer forth, and Cheriſher of Diviſion, Falſhood, moſt bloody Butcheries, and barbarous Cruelties, this is a Myſtery.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. In being Queen Regent, riding upon the Beaſt in State, and yet being that good Woman that fled into the Wilderneſs, and abides there in a ſuffering Condition all the time of the Beaſt's Reign, this is a Myſtery. See our fourth Argument: One Proof of their Church is viſibility; yet it is evident the true Church for the ſpace of 260 Years was to be in the Wilderneſs, or in an obſcure Condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Fourthly, <hi>[Mother of Harlots, and Abominations]</hi> better agrees to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to Proteſtants.</p>
                              <p>'Tis againſt the Principles of Proteſtants, to allow Fornication or Adultery, in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of any Rank whatſoever, maintaining conſtantly, that Marriage is honourable, but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judg; whereas <hi>Rome</hi> gives publick tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to notorious Whoredoms, and the moſt ſhameleſs and unnatural Beaſtialities, as the whole World knows.</p>
                              <p>Fifthly, <hi>[For Mother of Harlots]</hi> in a Spiritual Senſe, ſhe is owned by all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be the Mother-Church. And</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Therefore Proteſtants are exhorted to return into the Boſom of their Mother.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. All polluted and National Churches in the <hi>European</hi> Kingdoms, ſprang from her, as the Churches of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. All Corruption in Doctrine and Diſcipline may call her Mother, that is to ſay, the falſe Titles and Errours following, <hi>viz.</hi> Univerſal, Supream, Infallible Head, Holy Father the Pope, His Holineſs in the Abſtract — Our Lord God the Pope, uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Church, Prieſtly Abſolution, Selling of Pardons, Indulgences, Diſpenſations, adoring the Crucifix, worſhipping of Images, fooliſh Croſſings, Anointings, and Sprinkling with Holy Water, the adoration of the Maſs, and many ſuch things, which from the beginning was not ſo.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. For Perſonal Vices: from whence come horrid Oaths and Blaſphemies, moſt aſtoniſhing Perjury, and ſubtile Equivocations, and Hypocriſies, all manner of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, Lying, and Adulteries, Covenant-breaking, and Bloody-mindedneſs: is this allowed and practiſed by the Proteſtants?

But becauſe it is never ſafe judging a Cauſe before Trial and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Witneſſes, we will,</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Conſider what it is to be drunk.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. What things do neceſſarily contribute to it.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. The true and proper Signs of it.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. Whether ſuch things can be fixed upon <hi>Rome Papal,</hi> or Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And then conclude this Head.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. To be Drunk, is an exceſſive taking in of ſuch Things, as diſorder Nature in its Courſe and Operations. This we take to be a general Definition of it, including the Proper and Metaphorical Notations thereof.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Such things as neceſſarily contribute to it; are, (1.) Great and vehement Thirſt: (2.) Plenty of the thing thirſted after. (3.) The greedy taking their fill of it.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. The Signs of Drunkenneſs are. (1.) When the Faculties are ſo diſordered, that they will not ſubmit to the beſt Reaſon that can be given them. (2.) When they will abuſe thoſe whom they are moſt obliged to love and reſpect. (3.) When they have caſt off all conſideration of their own and others Good, and forbear no Miſchief but what they are reſtrained from by force.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. That theſe things are evident in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and cannot be ſo fairly fixed upon her Oppoſites, or ſuppoſed Hereticks, appears:</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſhe hath ſhed a Maſs, a very great Maſs of Blood upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (all which was unlawfully ſhed) of this the whole Chriſtian World is a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. To clear her ſuppoſed Hereticks from this red and bloody Crime.</p>
                              <p n="1">(1.) It is againſt their Principle to kill Men for Religion, and this they do avowedly profeſs, pleading for Liberty of Conſcience, in Matters purely Religious in all places.</p>
                              <p n="2">(2.) They have wanted Power to do it, in caſe they had been for it in Principle, all Power being in the Hands of Papiſts before the Reformation.</p>
                              <p n="3">
                                 <pb n="320" facs="tcp:39531:176"/>(3.) Where there hath ſince been a Proteſtant Seate or Kingdom, governed by Laws different from that of the Popiſh Countries, yet they have not made uſe of their Power and Laws, to take away the Lives of Papiſts meerly for Religion; and if it hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at any time, that ſome Eccleſiaſtical Perſons have been put to Death by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; it has been but very rare and ſeldom, and the Cauſe not for their Religion, but for Sedition, Rebellion and Treaſon: otherwiſe they have lived peaceably under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Governours, enjoying their Civil Right in Common with other Men. And for the confirming of this, we make a Challenge to all Chriſtendom to come forth and make it appear, Where <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>
                                    <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> &amp;c. ſince the Reformation, have, by Maſſacres, Murders, or Martyrdom, put one thouſand, nay one hundred to Death of Men, Women and Children, only becauſe they profeſſed the Romiſh Religion, or any Religion different from theirs: ſo far have they been from making themſelves Drunk with the Blood of Saints, and Religious Men. And if this cannot be done, then having brought our Character within the Confines of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, we muſt neceſſarily charge this Drunkenneſs, by Blood, upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This Head we will conclude with the following Argument.</p>
                              <p>If no Sect of People in the Chriſtian World be guilty of ſo much Blood, drunk with Blood, innocent Blood, Blood of Saints, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is. Then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is this Woman, that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw, to his great aſtoniſhment, Drunk, with the Blood of the Saints, and the Martyrs of Jeſus.</p>
                              <p>But there is no Sect of People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> guilty of ſo much Blood, or Drunk with the Blood of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This is the place which hath had ſeven Soveraign Governments, five of which were gone off the Stage, and the ſixth, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Heathen Empire) was in Being in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time. (2.) The ſeventh was to appear and to continue but a ſhort ſpace (<hi>viz.</hi> the Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire): for it cannot be the Papal Power, becauſe that was not up in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, ſo not the ſixth Head; and as the Papal Power, for that Reaſon, could not be the ſixth Head, ſo for a very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it could not be the ſeventh Head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that whenſoever that did appear, it was to continue but a ſhort ſpace; which reſpects not the Papal Power, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Chriſtian Empire; for the Papal Power has continued longer than any of the other Soveraignties that went before: and if the Papal Power be neither the Sixth, nor ſeventh Head, then it muſt needs be the eighth, which is of the ſeventh, and goes into Perdition, or elſe it muſt be no Head or Power at all.

His Predeceſſors had Eyes like a Leopard, a Bear, a Lion, a Dragon; but this hath Eyes like a Man. In which there are three things to be noted: (1.) He looks higher, (2.) Sees fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, (3.) Is more enticing, than thoſe that went before him. (1.) He looks higher, that is, makes a pretence of Piety, and Deſign for Heaven. (2.) Sees fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Deceit, Flattery, and Policy, will do more than Strength. (3.) Is more enticing to Kings and People, than the Eyes of a Leopard, Lion, or Dragon, or the former Powers in their Heathen State.</cell>

                           <cell>V. The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a Mouth ſpeaking great or preſumptuous Things, above the ordinary rate of Men. This is evident in many reſpects, of which we ſhall give you but a few Inſtances out of many. (1.) That he is the higheſt Deputy of God, above all the Kings of the Earth. (2.) That he is infallible, and cannot err, which is an incommunicable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of the Moſt High. (3.) That he is univerſal Head and Biſhop of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. (4) He aſſumes the Attributes of <hi>his Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>holy Father;</hi> ſuch an Oracle, that has Right or Power to give Laws to the World, to which all ought to ſubſcribe, and yield obedience, and none ought to diſpute. Greater and more lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can no Man ſpeak, unleſs he will ſay, I am the Supreme Being, and there is no God in Heaven or Earth above my ſelf; which would be ſo highly ridiculous, that every Ideot would be able to detect it.</cell>

In his terrible Bulls, that he makes to roar and ſtare moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. (2.) In his Power and Acts of depoſing Princes. (3.) In aſſerting himſelf to be God's Vicegerent, againſt whom no Perſon, upon any Cauſe or Pretence whatſoever, ought to lift up Hand or Tongue, upon the Penalty of a total Ruine in this World, and an eternal Ruine in the World to come.</cell>

                              <p>VII.

                              <p>If the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> may be more fitly ſaid to have Eyes like the Eyes of a Man, a Mouth ſpeaking preſumptuous Things, and Looks more ſtout than his Fellows; to have made War with the Saints, to have prevailed againſt them, and wore them out, more than any other Power that ever yet reigned: Then he is the little Horn, or vile Perſon, under Conſideration.</p>

                              <p n="1">(1.) Sin deceived the Angels that fell, who were moſt glorious Creatures in their firſt Eſtate.</p>
                              <p n="2">(2.) Sin robbed and deceived <hi>Adam,</hi> who was ſo higly honoured and dignified by the Almighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <p n="3">3. Sin is an old Thief; no ſooner was the World created, but preſently we read of this Robber, and how he cheated our firſt Parents; O how many Ages, how long a Time hath this Thief reigned in his Wickedneſs?</p>

Sin is a ſubtile Thief, he robs and ſteals in the Day-time, as well as in the Night, and yet 'tis hard to find him out; he has many ſecret Corners to hide and lurk in, nay he hath got the Art to change his Name when he is taken, and charged with this or that Abomination. (1.) If you ſearch for him by the Name of Pride, he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the Name of Comlineſs and Decency. (2.) If you ſearch for him under the Name of Covetouſneſs, he calls his Name Induſtry, Thriftineſs, and Good-husbandry; nay he is grown ſo crafty, that ſome think 'tis impoſſible to find him out: under the laſt Appellation, he doth not only change his Name, but alſo prevails cunningly upon Men, according as he finds their natural Inclination and Diſpoſition; ſome he deceives
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:39531:183"/> by the Pleaſures of the World, ſome by the Profits and Riches of the World, and ſome he puffs up with Vain-Glory, and the Honours of the World. (3.) Sin deceives by pretending Kindneſs and Friendſhip to the Children of Men; Sin and Satan promiſe a future time, and Days to repent; they promiſe Heaven to the vileſt Sinner, promiſe Life, whilſt they thruſt the Knife into the very Throat.</p>

                              <p>But Legal Threatnings, denounce unmixed and unallayed Curſe and Wrath. Theſe two widely differ, not only in their Nature, but End. In the firſt, ſuppoſe, that the Buſineſs of the Threatnings be done to God's Hand, without the Execution of them, it clearly follows, that the Obligation of the Believer to them, as they have reſpect to ſuch an End, diſſolves and ceaſeth; that which is God's Intent by them, being obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without them, the execution of the Threatnings, without the leaſt derogation from the Truth of God, or Impeachment of his other Properties, may be ſuſpended.</p>
                              <p>But Legal Threatnings being of another Nature, and having another End, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Vindication of God's Holineſs and Juſtice upon Priſoners and Rebels, they are no wiſe diſſolvible, but muſt of neceſſity be inflicted, that the Perfections and Government of God may be vindicated, and Sin may be revenged. All Sin is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God's Authority and Government, and caſts Dirt upon his Glory, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is the vindicating of God's Honour, in revenge of Evil committed.</p>
                              <p>Let this be noted, that in caſe of ſuch a proportionable Satisfaction, by which the Honour and Equity of his Law is vindicated, his Juſtice, Holineſs, and Hatred of Sin demonſtrated, the ends of Government attained; he may relax and diſpenſe with the Threatning, as to the Party offending, which is the caſe here: for by executing the Threatnings upon Chriſt, and receiving a valuable conſideration of Satisfaction from him, he hath given as eminent demonſtration of his Righteouſneſs, Purity, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Sin, and as fully vindicated his Law from Contempt, as if the Offenders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had ſuffered; and therefore, by an admirable mixture of Grace with Juſtice, hath releaſed us. Theſe things being premiſed, I reaſſume (ſaith he) the Argument,<note place="margin">Ferguſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap>n.</note> namely, That the Truth of God's Threatnings, would not allow him to pardon Sin, and ſave Sinners, but upon the conſideration of a Satisfaction.</p>
                              <p>Firſt, God having denounced Death, and the Curſe againſt Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. The Veracity and Faithfulneſs of his Nature obliged him to ſee it inflicted: Never any entertained a Notion of God, but they included in it that he ſpake Truth. Could ever any Threatning of God, be of awe upon the Conſcience of a Sinner, ſhould the firſt and great Threatning be made ſo eaſily void? Should it be granted, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God's ſolemn Denunciation of Wrath, in caſe of Sin, that yet he hath taken the Offender into Favour, and pardoned the Offence without any Satisfaction, or Conſideration at all? what would Creatures imagine, but that God either intended his Threatnings for meer Scare-Crows, or that he were ſubject to Mutabili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>y; which Apprehenſion being once received, what boldneſs would Men aſſume in Sin? belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Comminations of the Goſpel, would be no more executed than thoſe of the Law: <hi>but let God be true, and every Man a Lyar.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Secondly; To ſuppoſe that God hath abrogated his Threatning, is at once to overthrow the whole Scripture; for that expreſly tells us, that <hi>not one jot of the Law was to periſh.</hi> Mat. 5.18. <hi>That every Diſobedience received a juſt Recompence of Reward, Heb.</hi> 2.2. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.28. &amp; 9.22, 23. <hi>That without Blood there was to be no Remiſſion.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Thirdly; If the Threatning annexed to the Law be releaſed, it is either by virtue of the Law it ſelf, or by virtue of the Goſpel. It is not by virtue of the Law; for that was wholly inexorable, requiring either perfect and conſtant Obedience, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing unmixed and unallayed Wrath. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Nor is it releaſed by the Goſpel; this the Holy-Ghoſt clearly informs us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid: yea, we eſtabliſh the Law. Beza</hi>'s Paraphraſe here is very good: <hi>Chriſti ſatisfactio quid aliud quàm Legis minas oſtendit minimè irritas eſſe, quàm illas luere Chriſtum oportuerit? O Chriſti Juſtitia, quid aliud eſt quam Legis praeſtatio?</hi> See alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Think not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that I am come to deſtroy the Law, or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil: For verily I ſay unto you, till Heaven and Earth paſs away, one jot, or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</hi> As all the Predictions of the Prophets were fulfilled by him, and in him, ſo was the whole Law in his keeping the Precepts of it, and teaching others to do the like, and in his bearing the Penalty of it, and fulfilling the Types of it. The Goſpel is ſo far from repealing the Penalty of the Law, that the very Goſpel it ſelf is founded on Chriſt's undertaking to bear the Penalty of it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 16. <hi>There could have been no Teſtament, but in and through the Death of the Teſtator.</hi> There could have been no ſuch thing as a Goſpel, or a Tender of glad Tidings and Mercy to us, but through Chriſt's undertaking, as our Surety, to bear the Curſe of the Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. And ſo much for the Argument from the Truth of God's Threatning.</p>

                              <p>The Sum of what we ſay and believe about this great Truth, is this:</p>
                              <p>1. That by the Sin of our firſt Parents, all Men are brought into a State of Sin, and Apoſtacy from God, and of an Enmity to him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                              <p>2. That in this State all Men naturally continue, ſinning againſt God, nor of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can do otherwiſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12.</p>
                              <p>3. That the Juſtice and Holineſs of God, as he is the Supreme Governor and Judg of all the World, requires that Sin be puniſhed. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>4. That God hath alſo engaged his Veracity and Faithfulneſs in the Sanction of the Law, not to leave Sin unpuniſhed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Curſed be he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth not all the Words of this Law, to do them.</hi> In this State and Condition all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, had they been left without Divine Help and Aid, muſt have periſhed for ever.</p>
                              <p>5. That God, out of his infinite Grace and Goodneſs, ſent his Son, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver them.</p>
                              <p>6. That this Love was the ſame in Father and Son: The Father could not be more gracious and kind than the Son, nor the Son in Bowels exceed the Father; but both alike loving, gracious, and compaſſionate.</p>

But that Remiſſion of Sins is wholly through the free Love and Grace of God, is evident, yet not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had to the Atonement or Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, through Faith in Chriſt's Blood. <hi>For without ſhedding of Blood, there is no Remiſſion.</hi> Eph. 1.7. <hi>We have Redemption through his Blood, even the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> chap 4. v. 32. <hi>As God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.

It is abſolutely free, in reſpect of all immediate Tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Sinners, free on the part of God.</p>
                              <p>1. In the eternal Purpoſe of it, when he might juſtly have ſuffered all Men to have periſhed under the Guilt of their Sins.</p>
                              <p>2. Free in the Means that he uſed to effect it. (1.) In the ſending of his own Son. (2.) In laying the Puniſhment of our Sins upon him. (3.) In his Covenant with him, that it ſhould be accepted on our behalf. (4.) In his free Tender and Propoſal of it by the Goſpel, without Money, and without Price. (5.) In the actual Condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Pardon of them.</p>
                              <p>Secondly; It is free on the part of the Perſons that are forgiven, in that, <hi>(1.)</hi> It is given and granted to them, without any Satisfaction made by them, or a Surety of their procurement, they being not able to find any. (2.) Without any Merit to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or procure it. (3.) Without any penal ſatisfactory Suffering here or hereafter. (4.) Without any expectation of a future Recompence, or being once pardoned, they ſhould make or give any Satisfaction for what they had done before. And as none
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:39531:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> none of thoſe Things would, ſo nothing elſe can impeach the Freedom of Pardon and Forgiveneſs. Whether then we reſpect the Pardoner, or the Pardoned, Pardon is every way free, namely on the part of God who forgives, and on the part of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are forgiven.</p>
                              <p>If God hath now, beſides all this, provided himſelf a Lamb for a Sacrifice; if he hath, in infinite Wiſdom and Grace, found out a way thus freely to forgive us our Debts, to the Praiſe and Glory of his own Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Severity againſt Sin, as well as to the magnifying of his Grace, Goodneſs, and rich Bounty, which he immediatly exerciſeth in the Pardon of Sin: Are any Mans Eyes evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is good? Will they not be contented to be pardoned, unleſs they may have it at the rate of ſpoiling or robbing God of his Holineſs, Truth, Righteouſneſs, and Faithfulneſs. Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>

                              <p>Object. <hi>But doth not this Doctrine ſet forth God to be ſevere to his own Son, to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute him in the Sinners room, to bear his Wrath, and ſuffer for their Sins?</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Anſw.</hi> God laid nothing upon his bleſſed Son, but what Chriſt offered himſelf free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to undergo for Man's ſake; and had it not every way conſiſted with his own Glory, thus to deliver up the Lord Jeſus, to ſatisfy both Law and Juſtice, doubtleſs he would never have ſent him into the World. And if it had been only to make Chriſt a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Humility, and of Patience under Suffering, that God laid theſe things upon him which he endured, it might have left ſome room for Men ſo to ſpeak, in that others might, as indeed many of the Godly have been made Examples upon that account.</p>
                              <p>Object. <hi>If God cannot pardon Sin without Satisfaction, he is more weak and imperfect than Man.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God cannot do many Things that Man can do; not that he is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect than they, but he cannot do them upon the account of his Perfection: He cannot lie, he cannot change, cannot deny himſelf, which Men can, and do daily.</p>
                              <p>2. To pardon Sin without Satisfaction, in him who is abſolutely holy, righteous, true and faithful, the abſolute, neceſſary, Supreme Governor of all Sinners, the Author of the Law, and Sanction of it, wherein Puniſhment is threatned and declared, is to deny himſelf, and to do what one infinitely perfect cannot do.</p>
                              <p>3. Why doth not God pardon Sins freely, without requiring Faith, Repentance, and Obedience in them that are pardoned? yea, as the Conditions on which they may be pardoned: For ſeeing he is ſo infinitely good and gracious, cannot he pardon Men, without preſcribing ſuch Terms and Conditions unto them, as he knows that Men, and that incomparably the greateſt Number of them, will never come up unto, and ſo muſt of neceſſity periſh for ever? Yea, but our Adverſaries ſay, this cannot be, neither doth this impeach the Freedom of Pardon: For it is certain, that God doth preſcribe theſe things, and yet he pardoneth freely; and it would altogether unbecome the holy God, to pardon Sinners that continue impenitent, and ſo live and die. But doth not the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſee, that he hath hereby given away his Cauſe which he contendeth for? For if a Preſcription of ſundry things to the Sinner himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he ſhall not be pardoned, doth not at all impeach (as they ſay) the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Pardon, but God may be ſaid freely to pardon Sin notwithſtanding it; how ſhall the receiving of Satisfaction by another, (nothing at all being required of the Sinner) have the leaſt appearance of any ſuch thing? If the Freedom of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs conſiſts in ſuch a boundleſs Notion as theſe Men imagine, it is certain that the preſcribing Faith and Repentance unto Sinners antecedently to their participation of it, is much more evidently contrary unto it, than the receiving Satisfaction from another, who is not to be pardoned, can to any appear to be. Secondly, If it be contrary to the Holineſs of God, to pardon any, without requiring Faith, Repentance and Obedience in them, as it is indeed; let not theſe Perſons be offended, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, when he ſo frequently declares it, that it was ſo, to remit Sin, without the fulfilling his Law, and ſatisfying of his Juſtice.

                              <p>IV. But it is not ſo here in reference to this Debt; for tho Chriſt, as our Surety, hath made a full Compenſation to the Law and Juſtice of God, yet Sinners are not immediately acquitted; neither doth
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:39531:186"/> it follow, (ſaith the Doctor) that on the ſuppoſition of Satisfaction, pleaded for the Freedom, Pardon, and Acquitment of Perſons originally guilty, and liable to Puniſhment, muſt immediatly, and <hi>ipſo facto</hi> enſue, it is not of the Nature of every Solution or Satisfaction, that Deliverance muſt <hi>ipſo facto</hi> follow. And the reaſon of it is, becauſe this Satisfaction by ſuccedaneous Subſtitution of one to undergo Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for another, muſt be founded in a voluntary Compact and Agreement; for there is required unto it a Relaxation of the Law, tho not as unto Puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, yet as unto the Perſon to be puniſhed. And it is otherwiſe in perſonal Guilt, than in pecuniary Debts: In theſe, the Debt it ſelf is fully intended, and the Perſon obliged with reference thereunto in the other, the Perſon is firſtly and principally under the Obligation. And therefore when the pecuniary Debt is paid, by whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be paid, the Obligation of the Perſon himſelf unto Payment ceaſeth <hi>ipſo facto:</hi> But in Things criminal the guilty Perſon himſelf being firſtly, immediatly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally under the Obligation unto Puniſhment, when there is introduced by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact a <hi>vicarious Solution,</hi> in ſubſtitution of another to ſuffer, tho he ſuffer the ſame ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, which the Perſon ſhould have done for whom he ſuffers; yet becauſe of the ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>It appears from what hath been ſaid, that in this matter of Sin being called a <hi>Debt,</hi> and of Satisfaction, Sin is not to be conſidered as ſuch a Debt, and God a Creditor, and the Law as an Obligation to the Payment of that Debt, as ſome Men ſeem to run it: But Sin is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law, and thereby obnoxious and liable to the Puniſhment conſtituted in it, and by it anſwerable unto the Juſtice and Holineſs of another; and God, as the infinitely holy and righteous Author of that Law, and Supreme Governor of all Mankind, according to the Sanction and Tenor of it. <q>The Subſtitution of Chriſt was meerly voluntary on the part of God, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, undertaking to be Sponſor, to anſwer for the Sins of Men, by undergoing the Puniſhment due unto them. That to this end there was a Relaxation of the Law, as to the Perſons that were to ſuffer, tho not as to what was to be ſuffered: Without the former, the Subſtitution mentioned could not have been admitted; and on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the latter, the Sufferings of Chriſt could not have had the Nature of Puniſhment, properly ſo called; for Puniſhment relates to the Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Government of him that inflicts it; and this the Juſtice of God doth not but by Law. Nor could the Law be any way ſatisfied or fulfilled by the Suffering of Chriſt, if antecedently thereunto, its Obligation, or Power of obliging unto the Penalty conſtituted in its Sanction unto Sin, was relaxed, diſſolved, or diſpenſed withal.

                     <p>THis ſhews what the Nature of Sin is, together with the woful and miſerable Condition of Man thereby. How few know, or are ſenſible, how far they are in Debt, and what fearful Danger they are in hereby every moment!</p>

                     <p n="3">III. Let us alſo from hence be ſtirred up to cry for Pardon and Forgiveneſs of our Sins: <hi>Forgive us our Debts.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We pray, that God would not require or exact Payment and Satisfaction for our Sins of us; for if he ſhould paſs by Millions of Sins, and ſet down but one hundred, nay, come ſo low as to charge but ten, nay, forgive us all ſave only one, that one would ſink us down to the loweſt Hell. Should God require us to make ſatisfaction but for one evil Thought, we ſhould be utterly undone.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:39531:186"/>2. We pray, (ſaith Mr. <hi>Burges</hi>) that God would lay our Sins upon Chriſt, or accept of Satisfaction in and through him; for ſeeing (ſaith he) God hath declared his Will, that Man ſhall die for Sin; if we ſhould pray, that he would abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Sins, it would be to pray that he might be unjuſt. Therefore in this Prayer thus we may argue, O Lord, we call not upon thee to repeal any Threatning, to nullify thy Word, to become unjuſt; but thy Wiſdom hath ſo found out a way, that we may be pardoned, and thou ſatisfied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We pray, that through Chriſt's Atonement, or the Propitiation of his Blood, our daily Sins and Infirmities may be forgiven us, and we kept in a State of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for if our former Sins ſhould be forgiven, and not our preſent and future, our Caſe would be deſperate; for Sin, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Hair, tho cut, it will grow again. And as we ſin daily, ſo we ought to pray for Pardon, through Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation; for Sin is not actually forgiven, before committed, nor before we have the true Senſe and Sorrow of it upon our Hearts. Where God gives Remiſſion, he gives a broken Heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We pray, that God would account or impute Chriſt's Righteouſneſs unto us for Pardon.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We pray for the ſenſe and feeling of the Grace and Bleſſing of Pardon in our own Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s; for it is one thing to be pardoned, and another thing to know, or have the feeling ſenſe of it our ſelves. We are in this Caſe (ſaith an eminent Perſon) like ſome Heir or Prince, that hath many temporal Dignities, but by reaſon of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy doth not underſtand it. We pray principally, 1. For the real Exhibition of Pardon; and, 2. For the Declaration and Manifeſtation of it in our Conſciences. Some ſay, That God, from all Eternity, hath pardoned Sins paſt, preſent, and to come; and that when we believe or repent, our Sins are pardoned declaratively only to our Conſciences; but now, I ſay, We pray not only for Aſſurance and Manifeſtation of Pardon, but for Pardon it ſelf. The Reaſons are:</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) We might by the ſame Rule interpret all the other Petitions, in regard of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration only, and not of Exhibition. When we pray for Sanctification and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, in that Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> it might be as well ſaid, that we are ſanctified and glorified from all Eternity; and therefore when we are ſaved and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in Heaven, this is but to our ſenſe and feeling. And thus Men make the Decrees of God to be from Eternity, with the Execution of them in Time. How ridiculous would it be to expound that Petition, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread,</hi> thus! <hi>viz.</hi> Not that God ſhould give us our daily Bread, but make us to ſee and feel that he hath given it to us.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) A ſecond is from the Nature of Forgiveneſs it ſelf: When Sin is pardoned, it is ſaid to be blotted out; now can any think, that blotting out is only in a Man's own Conſcience and Feeling? It is more immediatly out of God's Book, (it being a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor taken from blotting or croſſing Debts out of a Book of Accounts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and not only the Guilt that lies upon our Hearts; therefore theſe are very ſeparable the one from the other. A Man may feel no Weight or Burthen of Sin upon him, and yet it ſtand in red Characters in God's Book: and on the contrary, a Sin may be blotted out there, yet be very heavy and terrible in a Man's feeling and apprehenſion. So Sin pardoned is ſaid to be covered or hid, not in reſpect of us, as if it were taken from our Sight, but from God's Sight; and he is ſaid to caſt our Sins behind his Back.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) This Explication, as the whole Sence of the Petition, would overthrow all other Scriptures, which make no Pardon of Sin to be, but where the Subject hath ſuch Qualifications as this in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> forgiving others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) This which theſe Men ſay, would make no difference between Sins repented of, and Sins not repented. Where do we read, that God doth (like the Pope) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedate his Pardon, before the Sin be committed, or repented of? <hi>Burges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. We pray, That as God doth forgive Sin, ſo alſo he would releaſe the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and take away all the Wrath that doth belong to it. It is but a Mockery which Papiſts make about Pardon, as if indeed God did pardon the Sin, but not the Puniſhment; that that abides ſtill, and we muſt work out a Releaſe from that by our own ſelves. It is true, God, tho he doth pardon Sin, yet he may grievouſly afflict; but theſe are only fatherly Chaſtiſements, and not judicial Puniſhments. But in this Prayer we deſire, as the Sin is removed, ſo alſo whatſoever Troubles, Afflictions, or Chaſtiſements do remain, that they likewiſe may be taken away; that as the Gulf of Hell is removed, ſo every Cloud alſo may be diſpelled.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:39531:187"/>7. We pray not only for Pardon, but alſo for the gracious Concomitants and Effects of it, which are Peace with God, and Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                     <p>From the Whole we may infer,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That Man is a guilty Sinner, (nay, that Believers are not without Sin, as they are in themſelves) Man, as conſidered in his fallen State, is accuſed and charged by the Law, and muſt plead, and he cannot plead, <hi>Not guilty,</hi> being under the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of his own Conſcience, <hi>Ille noſcens ſe damnat quo peccat die.</hi> This might have been the Plea of <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, but none elſe. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>There is no Man that ſinneth not.</hi> Eccleſ. 7.20. 1 John 1.8. Our Plea then muſt be, <hi>Guilty;</hi> and in this Caſe we muſt plead Mercy for the ſake of Mercy, or Mercy for the ſake of Chriſt, or upon the account of the Satisfaction he hath made.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. There is ro pleading Mercy for the ſake of Mercy, for (as one well obſerves) that were not to plead, but to beg; nor were it at all to be juſtified, but meerly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; it were to be dealt with alone upon the Score of Grace, and not at all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Score of Righteouſneſs, whereas Juſtification is an Act of Juſtice rather than Mercy: tho it is true, in the Salvation of Sinners both Grace and Juſtice (as hath been ſhewed) meet together; we are both pardoned and juſtified. God is (ſaith one) as merciful as we can deſire, and yet as righteous as himſelf can deſire; there is the freeſt Grace, and the fulleſt Juſtice. As God pardons Sin, he diſplays his Mercy; as he juſtifies us from Sin, he manifeſts his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Pardon is free to us, but it coſt Chriſt dear; there is a Myſtery in the Remiſſion of Sin; it is not forgiven without Atonement, Satisfaction, and Reconciliation made for it by J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>DEath is like a venemous Serpent, that hath a cruel and tormenting Sting, and this Sting is Sin.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Sting of ſome Serpents, in the Fleſh, is very painful, it makes ſuch to cry out exceedingly: So ſuch who feel themſelves ſtung with Sin, cry out, like as thoſe did in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. The pain and torment of a wounded Conſcience is intolerable, as many can experience, and the Hiſtory of <hi>Francis Spira</hi> abundantly ſhews.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Venom or Sting of ſome Serpents is mortal, it killeth the Body: ſo Sin, that Venom of Death and the Devil, killeth both Body and Soul.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. If a Serpent biteth or ſtingeth any one part, the Venom and Contagion ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over all the Body, and deſtroyeth the whole Man: ſo the Sting and Poyſon of Sin, which entered by one Man's Offence,<note place="margin">Rom. 5 15, 18.</note> hath infected and killed all the Lump of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: moreover, he that harboureth but one Sin in his Boſom, it will deſtroy his whole Soul, if this Sting be but in his Tongue, 'tis like the Poyſon of Aſps, his Life muſt go for it, without ſpeedy help.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. No Salve or Medicine could heal the Bodies of thoſe who were ſtung with thoſe fiery Serpents in the Wilderneſs, till they look'd up to the Brazen Serpent, no Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian on Earth could cure them:<note place="margin">Dioſcor. l <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>30.</hi>
                        </note> ſo no work of Man can cure the biting of Death and the Devil, or Sting of Sin, but the Venom thereof rageth and raigneth tormenting the Conſcience, untill the Soul looks up by a true and lively Faith to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="7">VII. As ſome Serpents cannot hurt when they have loſt their Sting; ſo Death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt a Soul, whoſe Sin is taken away by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>WOunds are either new, which we commonly call green Wounds, or elſe old Wounds: Now Sinners have an old Wound upon them, which is like a ſtinking Ulcer, which they received above five thouſand years ago: in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi> was wounded by his Sin, in eating of the forbidden Fruit, all his Poſterity were wounded in him; alſo every Sinner hath many freſh Wounds upon him.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note>

                     <p n="3">III. Some Perſons have been full of Wounds, wounded from the Crown of the Head to the Soles of the Feet, they are (as it were) nothing but Wounds: ſo Sinners are full of Wounds, every Sin is like a Wound, or makes a Wound in the Soul; ſo many Sins a Man is guilty of, ſo many Wounds he hath in his inward Man. Every Faculty of their Soul is wounded: (1.) Their Judgment is corrupt. (2.) Their Underſtanding darkned, full of Vanity, Blindneſs, Incredulity, Enmity and Unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs. (3.) The Will, that noble Faculty, is wounded, and fearfully depraved; the Mind of a Man being corrupt, the Will muſt needs be corrupt: As to a Man that hath his Pallate poſſeſt with a vicious Humour, every thing ſeems bitter according to the Humour; ſo the Underſtanding reckoning the ways of God both Enmity and Folly, the Will acts accordingly.

                     <p n="8">VIII.

                     <p n="9">IX. Some Sores, Wounds and Scabs, bring Shame upon ſuch who have them: Sin is ſuch a Sore, and ſo hateful a Scab, that it cauſes Shame, and Confuſion of Face. Sin is the ſhame of any People,<note place="margin">Phil. 3 19.</note> and yet how do ſome glory in it? <hi>They glory in their Shame!</hi> Sin is the ſoul Diſeaſe; the Hurt, nay all the Hurt, Sorrow, and Shame Sinners meet with, came in originally by Sin, by yielding to the Devil, and by adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from God: no running Sore, no Scab, no breaking out in the Fleſh, like Sin in the Heart and Life of a Sinner.</p>

Some Wounds are Mortal: Sin makes a mortal Wound; <hi>The Soul that Sins ſhall die;</hi> and, <hi>unleſs ye believe that I am he, ye ſhall die in your Sins. If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die,</hi> &amp;c. I do not ſay there is no Help, nor Cure for theſe Spiritual Sores and Wounds; yet I muſt ſay they are incurable, as to Man, no Man can find by all his Skill and Art any healing Medicine. And upon this account the Lord ſaid of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael, their Wound was incurable,</hi> they had brought themſelves into ſuch a Condition, that none could help them, nor bring them out; <hi>O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi> Indeed ſome Men are ſo deſperately and dangerouſly wounded, that there is little hope of them, they have all the ſigns of Ruine and Eternal Death upon them imaginable.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If a Man ſins, and is ſorely wounded, and yet continues in his Sinful Courſe, the Sting is not pulled, as it were, out of his Fleſh, I mean out of his Heart, nor is he willing it ſhould; there is little hopes at preſent of this Man. Can a Wound
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:39531:189"/> be healed and yet the venemous Sting ſtick faſt in him? A continual courſe or cuſtom in Sin, tho they be ſmall Sins comparatively, may prove deadly.</p>

                        </gap>in is in the Affection 'tis dangerous You know when the Heart is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrupt, there is no hopes of Life: if in times of Infection you can keep it from the Heart, you are well enough. Phyſicians, tho they have Medicines to keep In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Heart, yet they have no Medicine to cure the Heart, if once the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gets into it. When a Man cloſes in with his Sin, likes it, loves it, and makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to fulfil the Luſts of it, 'tis a dangerous ſign.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the Wound ſpreads and increaſeth, or a Perſon grows more vain, carnal, and filthy, 'tis a ſad ſign. Some Men have been for a time cautions, and ſomewhat tender, their Conſciences have reſtrained them from yielding unto Sin, but afterwards they came to grow more hard and bold, and have adventured on this and the other Evil, and ſo by degrees from little Sins make no Conſcience of greater, till they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in Wickedneſs, and this after common Illuminations; this is a ſign they are near Hell.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When a Perſon is ſorely and grievouſly wounded, and yet is unſenſible, does not cry out, nor feel any pain, 'tis a ſad ſign. Come to ſome wounded Perſons, and ask them how they do; they will anſwer you, Very well, I ail nothing, then Relations begin to weep: ſo ſome Sinners, through a cuſtom of Sin, grow inſenſible, they are paſt feeling, they are not only without pain themſelves, but laugh at ſuch who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their <hi>Sores upon the Head, and mourn for their Sin;</hi> of this Man you may write in Red Letters, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. When a Man is dangerouſly wounded, and nothing that is given him will go down, neither Food nor Phyſick; or if he doth take it, yet it will not ſtay with him, 'tis a very bad ſign: ſo when a Sinner refuſeth all good Counſel that is given him, and inſtead of vomiting up, by true Repentance, his Sin, he vomiteth up the Phyſick and Food of his Soul that ſhould do him good, and deſpiſes all Reproof,<note place="margin">Prov. 28.1.</note> hardning himſelf againſt it, he is near to Deſtruction.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And Laſtly, When a Man is wounded, and that Balſam, Means or Medicine, that ſeldom fails to work a Cure in others, yet will do him no good, but contrary-wiſe, whilſt in Cure, and under the beſt Means, he grows worſe and worſe, there is little hopes of him: ſo when a Sinner under a powerful and Soul-ſaving Miniſtry, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſore Afflictions, is not at all reformed, but grows worſe and worſe, his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is bad; it may be that Sermon that works no change at all in him, hath tended, through the Mercy of God, to the Converſion of ſeveral Souls who were as ſorely wounded as he. If a Phyſician gives the beſt Medicine he has, and lays on a moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Plaiſter, and yet the Patient ſaith, Sir, that which you preſcribed hath done me no good; I wonder, ſaith he, it ſeldom fails me, I fear your Condition, I muſt give up, I have done what I can for you, the Lord pitty your Soul, you are no Man for this World; 'tis an Argument that Wound or Sickneſs will be unto Death, when the beſt Preaching, the beſt Means that can be made uſe of, will not work upon a Man's Heart; he is under Loſſes and Affliction, and divers melting Providences, but nothing will do.</p>

Some apply the Promiſes of God to Sinners, before their Wounds were ever lanced, or their Sores laid open, and the Corruption let out: this is but skinning over the Sore, and to leave it to feſter and rancle inwardly; the proud Fleſh muſt with ſome corroding Plaiſter be taken down, thou wanteſt through Humiliation for Sin.</p>

                     <p>THe Leproſy proceedeth from poyſoned and corrupted Humors in the Body: So Sin is nothing elſe but the poyſonous and corrupt Humors of the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Plague of the Leproſy ſpreads over every part of the Body: So Sin hath ſpread it ſelf over the whole Lump of Mankind, and over every Faculty of the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. No Diſeaſe is more ſtinking and hateful to Men than the Leproſy: So nothing is more abominable and deteſtable in the ſight of God, and ſincere Chriſtians, than Sin.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. No Diſeaſe is more contagious and infectious than the Leproſy; the Plague of the Peſtilence (ſaith a Divine) is not ſo infectious as the Plague of the Leproſy;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>

                     <p n="5">V. The Plague of the Leproſy ſeparated the infected Perſon from the Fellowſhip of all Men, whatever they were, if incurable, altho Kings; they were utterly and for ever excl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="6">VI. No Diſeaſe is more painful and mortal, or more incurable; therefore they were enjoined to put on mournful Apparel and Garments; it was ſo rarely and ſeldom cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that moſt carried it to their Graves: So Sin is very painful and tormenting, as we before have ſhewed.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The Symptoms of the Leproſy agree with the Symptoms and Effects of Sin.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bility and Weakneſs of all Parts in them that have this Diſeaſe, becauſe the Spirits are exhauſted: So Sin makes feeble, weakens, and debilitates the Powers of the Soul Hence <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he bleſſed <hi>Reuben,</hi> cries out, <hi>As weak and unſtable as Water, becauſe of his Sin.</hi> Saints have weak Hands, and feeble Knees oft times hereby.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is in a Leper a Tumor and Swelling in the Fleſh: So Sin ſwells a Man up in Pride, Vain-glory, and Self-conceitedneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is in them, ſaith my Author, a burning Thirſt, through the aduſt and burnt Blood by Melancholy, whereof it ariſeth: So Sin cauſeth an Inflammation and Burning of Anger, of Luſt, and vehement Thirſt after the World, Preferment, Pleaſures, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [See <hi>Poyſon.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is in them filthy, putrid Matter, breaking forth in a moſt loathſom man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: So ſuch as are greatly infected with the Plague of Sin, caſt forth nothing but horrid Pollution.

                     <p n="5">5. They have a hoarſe and weak Voice: So Sinners cannot pray, or if they do,<note place="margin">John 9.</note> they cannot be heard. God hears not Sinners.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They have a ſtinking Breath and Mouth, and therefore they muſt cover their Lips, leſt by their Breath they ſhould infect others: So Sinners have a filthy Breath: Their Mouths are full of unclean and adulterous Speeches, belching forth nothing but vile and abominable Oaths, Curſings, and ſlanderous Accuſations againſt the Godly, and ſometimes alſo againſt one another; but theſe ſeldom cover their Lips.</p>

                     <p>WHat an horrid Diſeaſe, and Plague of Plagues, is Sin! Every Man hath a running Plague-Sore upon him. Who is it that is not a Leper from the Womb? We were all born with this Plague; we brought it into the World with us. Every Man, as he is in himſelf, may cry out, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean, unclean.</hi> Sin hath ſpread it ſelf over us like a Leproſy.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Wicked Men are miſerable, whoever they are, if not cured of this Plague. Sin renders a Man more hateful to God, than an ugly Toad is to us.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It may caution Saints to ſhun the Company of a vile Sinner, and dread Sin, and flie from it, as from the Plague. Nothing that Sinners touch, but they defile, infect, and taint it, (till they are cleanſed) whether earthly or heavenly Things; all Creature-Comforts and Actions are unclean to them hereby: The very Plowing of the Wicked is Sin,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.4. Tit. 1.13.</note> yea, the Sacraments, Prayers, or Alms, all is polluted, ſo long as they are unconverted. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that are defiled, nothing is pure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. A wicked Man can converſe with no Man, but, as a Leper, he infects him by his ill Example; he endangers the Lives and Souls of Men.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. It may teach the Saints to bleſs God, and admire his Grace, who hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them from the Contagion of Sin.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.14.</note>

                     <p n="6">VI. None but the High-Prieſt pronounced a Perſon clean from the Leproſy: ſo none but Chriſt can diſcern our Uncleanneſs, and pronounce us clean, and wholly free from the Plague of Sin.</p>

                        <l>Like to an Ulcer, or infectious Biles,</l>

                     <p>POyſon inflames, heats, and (as it were) ſets the Body on fire: So Sin inflames, heats, and ſets (as it were) a Man's Spirit on fire.

                     <p n="2">II. Poyſon cauſeth a great and extreme Thirſt. Groſs or dreggiſh Liquor will not quench the fiery Thirſt of Poyſon;<note place="margin">Caryl.</note> it drinks (ſaith one) nothing but pure Spirits: So Sin ſtirs up an inſatiable Deſire or Thirſt after Revenge, as alſo after the Pleaſures,

                     <p n="3">III. Poyſon gets quickly (ſaith one) to the Spirit, 'tis ſubtil and ſpiritful,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> and in a very little time will corrupt the whole Maſs of Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Sin in a little time corrupted the whole Lump of Mankind. <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſooner ſinned againſt God, but the ſpiritual Poyſon and Venom thereof ſtruck to his Heart, corrupting every Faculty of his Soul, and not only ſo, but alſo the Souls of all his Poſterity. <hi>[See Wounds.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. 'Tis noted by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that when an Aſp ſtings a Man, it doth firſt tickle him, and makes him laugh, till the Poyſon by little and little gets to the Heart, and then it pains and torments him, more than ever it delighted him before: So doth Sin, it may pleaſe a little at firſt: <hi>Though Wickedneſs be ſweet in his Mouth,</hi>

                        <hi>tho he hide it under his Tongue, though he ſpare it, and forſake it not, but keepeth it ſtill within his Mouth: Yet his Meat in his Bowels is turned, it is the Gall of Aſps within him.</hi> Forbidden Profits and Pleaſures are very delightful to carnal Men, and many love to be medling with theſe poyſoning Morſels of Sin. Many eat that on Earth, which they digeſt in Hell. Men muſt not think to dine and dance with the Devil, and then to ſup with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in God's Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Poyſon in a Toad or Serpent, ſuits and agrees well with their Nature; but Poyſon in a Man's Stomach makes fearful Work, it being of a contrary Nature: So Sin in a wicked Man, one that hath no ſpark of true Grace in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeems to be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and agree well with him, his whole Nature being ſo grievouſly corrupted, and changed into the evil Nature thereof, he having uſed himſelf ſo long in ſinful Ways, that Sin, (<hi>viz.</hi> open Prophaneneſs, Superſtition, and Error) is habitual, and become natural to him, as Poyſon to a Toad. Naturaliſts ſay, That if a Man take a little quantity of Poyſon at a time, and ſo accuſtom himſelf to it,<note place="margin">☜</note> it will at length become ſo natural to him, that he may take it as Food: Even ſo wicked Men, by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Courſe and evil Cuſtom in Sin, drink it down as pleaſant Liquor, (like as the Fiſh drinks Water.) But now Sin to a true Chriſtian, is like much Poyſon in a Man's Stomach: 'tis contrary to that new Nature, and divine Principle, which is wrought in him by the Spirit of God; he cannot bear nor endure it, he hates every falſe Way:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>That which I hate, that do I.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Poyſon is deadly in its own Nature, and of a killing and deſtroying Quality, if not timely vomited up, by taking ſome fit and proper Antidote, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Sin, (whether fleſhly or ſpiritual, <hi>viz.</hi> ſenſual Debauchery, or Hereſy) will kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all where-ever it is, both Body and Soul, eternally, except by true Repentance it be vomited up. Tho Men take it down as ſweet Wine,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.31.</note> and are not preſently ſenſible of any harm; yet at laſt it will bite like a Serpent, and ſting like an Adder.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII.

                  <p>SPiritual Sickneſs is twofold; (1.) To be ſick with Sin. (2.) To be ſick of Sin: as Sin wounds the Soul, ſo it makes ſick, and this is Man's Miſery; but to be ſick of Sin, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to be ſenſible of the Evil and curſed Nature thereof, this is a Mercy.</p>

                     <head>Parallels.</head>
                     <p>THE Cauſes of Natural Sickneſs are divers, ſometimes it ariſes from ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſometimes from ſome outward Cauſe; to know from whence the Diſtemper grew or did ariſe is very neceſſary, whether it be Chronical or Acute, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which hath ſeized on the Patient on a ſudden, by Heats, Cold, or from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Blood, by an infectious Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which an able Phyſician is diligent to pry and ſearch into. Now as touching the Sickneſs of the Soul, 'tis evident the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Cauſe thereof, was by eating of the forbidden Fruit, which ſurfeited the whole Lump of Mankind; or (if you pleaſe) it was occaſioned by Poyſon, by the Poyſon of the old Serpent. Deadly Poyſon makes a Man very ſick, and corrupts the whole Maſs of Blood: And as 'tis needful to find out (if poſſible) the Cauſe of Sickneſs, ſo 'tis as neceſſary to find out the Cauſe of Spiritual Sickneſs; the Cauſe being diſcovered, the Cure is eaſy. If a Man doth not ſee what his ſtate is, as conſidered in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> nor the evil and damning Nature of Sin in general, nor the particular Plague of his own Heart, he is in no hopeful way of help and healing.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Some Sickneſſes or Diſeaſes are Epidemical: Sin is a Sickneſs or Diſeaſe ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and a Contagion ſo catching, that none have eſcaped, nor are totally free from it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Some are ſo ſick that they have no place free: Sin is a Diſeaſe that afflicts every part,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.</note> the whole Head is ſick, and the whole Heart faint.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Diſtemper which we call the Sickneſs, or Peſtilence, is very mortal, and ſweeps away thouſands: Sin is ſuch a Sickneſs, no Peſtilence like it; Sin is the Plague
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:39531:192"/> of Plagues. That which is moſt oppoſite to God, is the greateſt Evil; but Sin is moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and contrary to God, and therefore the greateſt Evil. That which ſeparates Man from, and deprives him of the greateſt Good, muſt needs be the greateſt Evil, or the Plague of Plagues; but Sin doth this, therefore the greateſt Evil. That which is the greateſt Judgment to be left unto, is the worſt of Evils; but 'tis the greateſt Judgment in the World, to be left or given up to the Luſts of our own Hearts: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> When God deſigns to bring his ſevereſt Wrath upon a People, or a particular Soul, when he reſolves to afflict them to the uttermoſt, he doth not ſay, I will bring Plague, or Sickneſs, or Famine upon them, but, I will deliver them up to their Sins. <hi>Iſrael would have none of me,</hi> &amp;c. and what then?<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.11. Rom. 1.26, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>So I gave them up to their own Hearts Luſts,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he gave up the Gentiles to vile Affections. That Sickneſs, Plague, or Peſtilence, that deſtroys moſt, that kills Millions, which is ſo infectious, that none amongſt Thouſands, nay, Millions of Thouſands, can eſcape, is the Plague of Plagues; but ſuch a Sickneſs is Sin. More ſhall be damned, than ſhall be ſaved; nay, but few comparatively enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and ſo find Life. Now all that are damned, are damned or deſtroyed by Sin, and therefore it is the worſt of Evils. That which kills or deſtroys Body and Soul too, is the Plague of Plagues; but Sin deſtroys Body and Soul too: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sin is the Plague of Plagues.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Many of thoſe who have the Diſeaſe we call the <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> have Spots upon them, which are of two ſorts, one of which are called the <hi>Tokens;</hi> and when they appear, they look upon themſelves as dead Men: So Sin, this ſpiritual Plague and Sickneſs of the Soul,<note place="margin">Deut. 31.4.</note> marks ſome Men out for eternal Death: <hi>Their Spot</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>is not the Spot of my Children;</hi> that is, their Sin is not a Sin of Infirmity, ſuch as appear upon the Children of God. Any Spot is bad, but ſome are worſe, very bad, they are deadly Spots, they have the Tokens of Death and Wrath upon them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Sin or Spot of a godly Man is rather a Scar or Wound that is healed, or almoſt healed: But Sin in ſome of the Ungodly, is like a rotten, putrifying Sore in the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Spots of the Godly are not ſo contagious or infectious as the Sins or Spots of the Wicked. The Sins of the Ungodly make their very Perſons and Prayers loathed and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in God's ſight; now God, tho he hates the Sins of his own Children,<note place="margin">Pſal 109.7.</note> yet he loves their Perſons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sin in a Saint is his Sorrow, 'tis that which he hates, it wounds and grieves his Soul,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.3.</note> he is ſick of his Sin; but the Wicked love their Sin. Sin is in a godly Man's Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and that is his Trouble; but Sin is in a wicked Man's Affection, which renders it to be a deadly Spot.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Sin reigns and predominates in the Hearts of the Wicked: But Sin, tho it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tyrannize in a Saint, yet he obeys it not, he is not the Subject or Servant of Sin: The one yields and ſubjects to Sin; the other oppoſes and reſiſts it, every Faculty of his Soul is ſet againſt it; and not only ſo, but againſt every Sin.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Sickneſs brings oft-times utter Weakneſs upon the Body: So Sin brings Weakneſs upon the Soul: <hi>I am feeble,</hi> &amp;c. It makes a Chriſtian very faint. [<hi>See</hi> Leproſy.]</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Some Sickneſs is very grievous to be born: So Sin is grievous to a true Chriſtian, who is made ſenſible of it.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. A Man that finds himſelf very ſick, and like to die, will ſoon look out for Help, or ſend to a Phyſician: So the Soul that is ſin-ſick, will ſeek for Help, <hi>viz.</hi> haſten to Jeſus Chriſt, for none elſe can cure the Sickneſs of the Soul.</p>

                     <p>A Vomit is a very loathſom Thing, but a Dog's Vomit is moſt deteſtable: So Sin is a very loathſom Thing, but Apoſtacy is the worſt of Sins; no Sin is more abominable in God's ſight than that.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A Vomit is caſt up ſometimes by reaſon of the Sickneſs of the Stomach: So a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian being very ſick of his Sin, caſts it up, or vomits it out by Repentance.</p>

Some Men finding themſelves oppreſſed by means of ſome Obſtructions, or by reaſon of the Foulneſs of their Stomachs, take ſomething to make them vomit, to free themſelves of that which otherwiſe may endanger their Health, if not their Lives: So a Chriſtian, being ſenſible of internal Obſtructions, and Pollutions of his inward Man, takes a fit Antidote of Chriſt's preparing, by which means he vomits up the Filth and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Heart and Life, and thereby attains a healthy Soul, and flouriſhes in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Some Men on a ſudden are made to vomit, by eating ſomething that offends, or agrees not with their Stomachs: So many Sinners, by hearing of a Soul-ſearching Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and by the Rebukes and continual Gnawings of their own Conſciences, vomit up ſome of the Sins of their Lives; but in a little time they grow more ſick of Religion than ever they were of their Sins, and ſo, with the Dog, they lick up their old Vomit again, <hi>i. e.</hi> turn to their former Ways of Sin and Error.</p>

                     <p>SOme things are ſo unclean and filthy, that they defile every thing they touch: Sin is ſuch an Uncleanneſs who can touch it, meddle with it, and not be defiled by it? 'tis an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Uncleanneſs: as Good is ſo much the better, by how much the more it is diffuſive, ſo Sin is ſo much the worſe, by how much it is the more infectious and diffuſive. Sin is diffuſive two ways. 1. By Propagation from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his Poſterity. 2. By way of Imitation.</p>

                     <p n="3">III. Some Uncleanneſs is active, prevailing and powerful, it encreaſeth and grows worſe and worſe, and defiles, and pollutes more and more; ſuch an Uncleanneſs is Sin. Man is unclean as he comes into the World, but this Uncleanneſs grows and prevails more and more upon him, by actual Sin he becomes worſe and worſe, and is more defiled every day; it ſtrives to captivate and bring the Souls of all Men under the defiling Power and Pollution of it.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note>

All the bodily Beauty in the World did never entice ſo many, as the Deformity and foul Face of Sin hath. Beauty and Comelineſs are the Attractives, the Loadſtone of Love; Chriſt was not loved by many, becauſe he did not appear beautiful, he vail'd his glorious Beauty: Luſt is loved, tho it be altogether unbeautiful. Chriſt is the Mirror of Beauty; tho ſome ſee no Comelineſs in him, he is <hi>fairer than the Children of Men:</hi> But there is no Form or Comelineſs in Sin, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed why it ſhould be deſired; yet how is it admired and eſteemed by all Sorts of Men!

                     <p>LEt us take heed we have not gray Hairs upon us, and know it not. Is not <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of God in <hi>England,</hi> grown here of late gray-headed? O what Signs and Symptoms of Ruine are there upon us! I will leave you to find them out. Where is that Love and Zeal that was once? Is not the World got into the very Hearts of Profeſſors? Do they not follow after the Wind, and purſue the Eaſt Wind? Are they not like an empty Vine? Doth not every one mind his own carnal Intereſt? Have not Strangers devoured our Strength? Are we not become like a ſilly Dove without an Heart? Is not Whoredom and Superſtition amongſt us? Doth not our Pride teſtify againſt us? And is not our Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs like the Morning-Cloud? Where is that Love and Bowels which ſhould be in us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another? Are not ſome of the Things, yea, the great Things of God's Law, accounted by us as ſtrange Things? Search further, and more gray Hairs will appear. Are we not divided and broken in Judgment? Can a Nation divided againſt it ſelf, long ſtand? — Are there not many faithful Miniſters ſnatch'd away in a ſhort time? Is not this the Fore-runner of ſome diſmal Calamity? Have not we had many fearful Signs in the Heavens? And are not the Evening-Wolves come out of their Holes? Beſides all this, let every Soul ſearch and ſee what gray Hairs he hath upon himſelf.</p>

By perſuading the Soul it is no great matter, 'tis, ſaith he, but a little one. 2. By preſenting the Pleaſure and Profit of ſinful Practices, and hiding the Shame thereof, and the Wrath and Miſery they will certainly bring on the Soul at laſt. 3. He lays before a Man the Sins of good Men, O ſaith he do you not find that ſuch and ſuch Godly Men have done as bad as this, was not <hi>David</hi> overcome with Adultery, <hi>Ezekiah</hi> with Pride, and <hi>Noah</hi> with Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all the while he ſtrives to hide from them their Vertue and unfeigned Repentance, and utter abhorrence of theſe Sins afterwards. 4. He preſents God to the Soul, as one made up all of Mercy, and that Repentance will make all whole again; but afterwards, it may be, when the Soul is defiled by yielding to his Temptation, perſuades Souls the Sin is ſo great, and God ſo juſt, that he will not pardon Sin, 'tis little before committed, but great when 'tis committed, and this way he ſeeks to enſnare the Sinner. 5. Another way he hath to catch his Prey with, is by leading the Soul into the way of Sin, it may be, to the Harlots, Door, he allures into the Company of Sinners, and entices the Soul to contemplate upon Sin to toy a little with <hi>Dalilah</hi> (as it were) and a Multitude of other Snares he hath.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. A Hunter, that he may the better catch his Prey, hath not only his Snares, but alſo his Dogs, and them of every ſort fit for his Sport and Enterprize, he hath his ſetting-Dogs, his ſcenting Dogs, his race-Dogs, ſome to ſtart his Game, and others to purſue his Game, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Devil, the great Hunter of Souls, hath, beſides his ſubtile Wiles and Snares, fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to effect and accompliſh his Deſign; he has his Dogs (for ſo as we have ſhewed you elſe where) wicked Men are called, and them alſo of every ſort, ſome great ones, and ſome ſmall ones, ſome that are like ſetting-Dogs, who watch how they may trapan, and prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Godly to draw them into Sin, or into Sufferings; and others, who are like cruel Blood-Hounds, who, as being void of Mercy, endeavour to tear the Saints in pieces.</p>

                        <p n="7">VII. A Hunter is diligent to obſerve the Diſpoſition of the Creature he hunts, and alſo the places where it haunts: So the Devil, he obſerves the Diſpoſitions and natural Inclinations of Men and Women, and alſo all their haunts, that ſo he may the better prey upon them, he knows what Men are prone to Lying, and what Men are addicted to Covetouſneſs, and who are naturally inclined to the Luſts of Uncleanneſs, and who are ſubject to Paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and according to the various Tempers and Inclinations of Perſons, he ſuits his Temptations.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII.

A Fowler having taken divers Birds, he makes uſe of them, in a crafty manner, to bring others to his Net: So doth Satan, he this very way ſeeks, to allure Sinners, he ſets before the Eyes of the unwary Soul, how many Birds he hath got in his Snares, and yet they ſing moſt ſweetly, and leap about as if they had all Joy and Enlargements in the World; he would perſuade Gods Children none have ſo ſweet and pleaſant a Life as the Ungodly, who flouriſh in Proſperity, and are not plagued like other Men, and by this means, this cunning Fowler oft-times enſnares the Souls of Men.</p>

This was the Bait, but the Net or curled Hook is hidden, he ſeems to court her as a cordial Friend, as one that wiſhed her the greateſt Happineſs imaginable; but alas! his deſign was to catch her in the Net of Rebellion againſt God's Law, to deſtroy and undoe her for ever; <hi>In vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird.</hi>

                     <p>A Day is a certain Time; ſo many Hours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A natural Day is twenty four Hours, an artificial Day contains twelve Hours: So God allows a Man a certain and prefix'd Time to repent. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had a Day: <hi>O that thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy Day, the Things that belong unto thy Peace.</hi>

                     <p n="2">II. The Day is ſet in oppoſition to the Night, and it ſignifies the Time of Light: So the Time of God's Patience, whilſt the Goſpel is preached to Men, and God waits upon them, and ſtrives with them, to bring them over to the Knowledg of the Truth, is the Time of Light; and when God takes away the Means of Grace, and the Goſpel, from a Kingdom, Nation, or particular Soul, that is a Time of Darkneſs, and then it may be ſaid, the Day is gone, and Night is come upon them.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. 'Tis Day when the Sun riſes, and Night when the Sun ſets: So 'tis the Sinner's Day, whilſt the Goſpel-Sun ſhines, and the Means of Grace are continued to them; but Night then, when the Miniſtration of the Goſpel is taken away, and no more Means of Grace afforded to them.</p>

                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:39531:200"/>IV. The Day is Man's working Time; Labourers in the Field, when the Day is ended, go home, they can work no longer: So whilſt God affords the Goſpel, and Means of Grace, Sinners ſhould, like faithful Labourers, work hard, work out their own Salvation, labour for the Meat that periſheth not: for when that is gone, no Man can work; then the Things of their Peace will be hid from their Eyes, like as it fell out with <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. The Day brings great Light with it, which makes great Diſcoveries of Perſons and Things; whilſt the Night laſts, Men cannot ſee what is near them, neither the Good they may receive, nor the Evil they ſhould refuſe, and eſcape from; but the Day diſcovers all, and makes every thing manifeſt: So the Goſpel-Day brings Light, and the Light thereof diſcovers the Evil that is in the Hearts, Works, and Lives of Men; by this Light they ſee their Sins, and the Danger they are in thereby, and alſo the Way to be delivered from them. Chriſt is the Way which the Day-Light makes manifeſt. In the Night of Popery, Men loſt the bleſſed Path to Peace, and Way of Life, and ran to the Merits of their own Ways, and to Popiſh Pardons, and what not? but the Day of the Goſpel in <hi>England</hi> hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Miſtake, and ſhewed them the plain Way to Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="7">VII. The Day ſometimes is over-caſt, and the Light darkned: So the Goſpel-Day is ſometimes, as a Judgment upon a People or particular Soul, darkned, and Clouds ſeem to cover the glorious Heavens, even as at this Time. O what thick and black Clouds ſeem to ariſe!</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Some Days prove ſtormy, and high Winds ariſe: So ſometimes the Day of Goſpel-Grace proves ſtormy, and high Winds of Perſecution ariſe upon a People; nay, not only Winds of Perſecution, but alſo ſtrange Whirl-winds of Deluſions abound in it, which make it very perilous.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. A Day hath its Morning, its Noon, and its Evening: So hath the Day of Goſpel-Grace in a Nation, and to a particular Soul, who improves it not. God threatned his People of old,<note place="margin">Mich. 3.6.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Sun ſhould go down over the Prophets, and the Day ſhould he dark over them.</hi>

                     <p n="10">X. The Day ſuits not with ſome Men, they are for the Night; they are ſaid to rebel againſt the Light, they hate the Light, the Night is for them; ſuch are the Thief and Adulterer:<note place="margin">Pov. 7.9.</note> 
                        <hi>The Whoriſh Woman waits for the Twilight, even for the black and dark Night.</hi> So many Sinners love not the Day of Goſpel-Light, they are for the Night of Ignorance and Error. They had rather have Popery come, or any Thing come, than to have the Goſpel, or the powerful Preaching thereof; it ſuits beſt with their carnal Hearts, they love that Religion that indulges them in their brutiſh Luſts.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. There are many ways to know when the Day draws towards an end, and Night approaches: As, (1.) When the Heat of the Sun abates. (2.) When the Shadows grow long, or are ſtretched forth. (3.) When the Harveſt-Men begin to go home apace. (4.) When the Evening-Wolves begin to lurk out of their Holes. Now when theſe Signs are upon a People in a ſpiritual ſence, their State is bad, they may fear Night approaches upon them. (1.) When the Goſpel in its powerful Preaching, abates in its Heat, and bleſſed Influences upon Mens Hearts, ſo that but a few are warmed, and effectually wrought upon by it. (2.) When Religion is more in Shew than in Subſtance; when the Shadow is long, and the Subſtance little; Men being more zealous for the Form, than concerned for the Power of it. (3.) When many powerful or painful Miniſters and Labourers are called home. (4.) When the Romiſh Wolves, who have lain long in their Holes, and dark Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, or lurking Places, begin to come boldly abroad, and impudently ſhew themſelves, 'tis a Sign of Evening-Tide, and that the Day is near expiring. Is not this thy State, O <hi>England?</hi>

                  <p>By <hi>Summer</hi> is doubtleſs meant that Time that God allows Men to gather in, and lay up ſpiritual Good for their precious Souls. The Time of Goſpel-Light, or Means of Grace, is compared to the Summer.</p>
                  <div type="parallels">
                     <head>Parallels.</head>
                     <p>THe Summer is the chief Time of the Year, that Seaſon which generally all Men prize, long for, and rejoyce in: So the Time of Goſpel-Grace, and Goſpel-Light, is the chiefeſt and choiceſt Seaſon in the World. The Time of the Goſpel, the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, was the Time which the Prophets, and many good and righteous Men of old longed for, and which all ſincere godly Perſons do prize, and rejoyce in.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Summer is the Seaſon that ripens the Fruits of the Earth; were it not for the Heat and Influence of Summer, what would become of the Husband-man's Labour? So the Means of Grace, or Miniſtration of the Goſpel, ripens the good Seed which is ſown in the godly Man's Heart, nay, it maketh all fit and ready for the Harveſt, and for cutting down. It ripens the godly Man for Heaven, and the ungodly Man for Hell: The Word is either a Savour of Life unto Life, or elſe the Savour of Death unto Death; it either ſoftens or hardens. It hath the ſame Effects upon Mens Hearts, that the Sun hath in the hotteſt Time of Summer, upon that which it ſends forth its Influence upon.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Summer is the poor Man's working Time, 'tis the Seaſon in which he is to provide himſelf for Winter with ſuch things he wants. The Day of Goſpel-Grace is the Saints Summer, 'tis the Time in which he works hard, gathers in, and lays up for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul: He <hi>learns of the Ant, who provides her Meat in Summer,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Prov. 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. In Summer every thing looks green; the Herbs, Graſs, Plants, Trees, and all the Fruits of the Earth, are in their Beauty, and greateſt Glory: So in the Day of Goſpel-Grace, whilſt God affords Means of much Light and Knowledg, when Seaſons, Sabbaths, Sermons, and Ordinances, in a plentiful manner do abound amongſt us, how do the Saints flouriſh, their Graces flouriſh! O what Beauty and Greenneſs is there upon all ſincere Chriſtians!</p>
                     <p n="5">V. He that is ſlothful and idle in Summer, as he brings Shame upon himſelf, ('tis a Sign of Folly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſo he ſuffers, wants Bread, and is expoſed to great Straits in Winter. <hi>He that gathereth in Summer, is a wiſe Son; but he that ſleepeth in Harveſt,</hi>

                        <hi>is a Son that cauſeth Shame.</hi> So he that is idle and negligent in the Time of Goſpel-Grace, or improves not the Means God affords, for the Good of his Soul, as 'tis a Reproach and Shame to him, ſo he expoſeth himſelf to Ruine thereby. What will he do when Death and Judgment comes? Then he will want, and ſuffer Hunger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>HArveſt is the Time to work and do buſineſs in, and it behoveth Men to labour hard then: So whilſt there is an open Door for the Goſpel, or God is pleaſed to continue the Means of Grace, Chriſt's Miniſters ought to labour hard.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Harveſt greatly tends to the relief of the Poor; they in Harveſt-time gather in, and lay up againſt a Time of Want and Scarcity: So do the Saints, whilſt the Day of Grace laſts, provide and lay up for their Souls.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="370" facs="tcp:39531:201"/>III. Sometimes there is bad Weather in Harveſt, which doth hinder and diſcourage the painful and laborious Husband-man: So Storms ariſe, and very bad Weather (as it were) often attends Chriſt's faithful Labourers, which greatly hinders them in their Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Harveſt is ſometimes great, and the Labourers but few, ſo that the Work lies very heavy upon ſome Men: So in a ſpiritual ſence, the Harveſt is great, <hi>i. e.</hi> many People are willing to hear God's Word, but there are but few painful Preachers, and by this means the Work lies heavy upon them; and when it is thus, we are enjoined to <hi>pray to the Lord of the Harveſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 9 37.</note> 
                        <hi>to ſend more Labourers into his Harveſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. The Harveſt ſometimes proves thin, and comes into a little Room; or it may ſeem much in Bulk, and yet but a little Grain: So 'tis ſometimes in the ſpiritual Harveſt, there are many Multitudes hear the Word, attend upon the Means, they flock into the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; but alas! but few are converted; the Corn is little: A ſmall Room will hold them, were they ſevered from the Straw and Chaff of the fruitleſs and unprofitable Multitude.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. When the Harveſt is like to be catching, or the Husband-man ſees Clouds begin to gather, and grow black, or they hear it thunder mightily, they work very hard, and hurry in the Corn, not knowing when they may have fair Weather again: So Chriſt's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when they perceive a diſmal Day approaching upon them, labour hard, and bring in what Souls they can into his Barn.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The Harveſt ſometimes is very long, and ſometimes but ſhort: So God lengthens or ſhortens the Day of Grace, as he pleaſes. The old World had an hundred and twenty Years; others but a ſhort Seaſon. <hi>O that thou hadſt known in this thy Day the Things that belong to thy Peace! but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi> Chriſt ſeems to be quick with them. And ſo it fared with thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. In Harveſt the Husbandman will not neglect a fit Opportunity of gathering in his Hay and Corn, upon preſumption of much fair Weather to come: So a wiſe Chriſtian will not loſe the preſent Seaſon for his Soul, upon hopes of much Time to come, but rather ſays, Now is the Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>THe Profeſſion of Godlineſs is in this, and divers other Scriptures, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Trade or Calling; and 'tis a very fruitful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Metaphor.</p>

                     <p>A Trade or Calling properly is that Art, Craft, or Occupation, whereunto one hath been trained, or wherein he exerciſeth and employeth himſelf, whatever it be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Handicraft, or Merchandizing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Godlineſs is the Occupation of every true Chriſtian, 'tis that which he hath been trained up in, 'tis that which he exerciſeth and daily employeth himſelf about. <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Actt 24.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Rather exerciſe thy ſelf unto Godlineſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A Man, when he firſt ſets up a Trade, hath, or ought to have, a Stock ſuitable to what it doth require, in order to the well-managing of it, or otherwiſe he is not like to do good of it; for the Want of a convenient Stock hath ruined and utterly undone many new Beginners: So every Chriſtian ought to ſee, when he firſt begins to profeſs Godlineſs, what Stock he hath, I mean, what Grace, what Faith, what Love to God, and to his Neighbour, what Experiences of a thorow Change; for without a Stock of the Truth of Grace, and Work of Regeneration, no Man can follow the Trade of Godlineſs, to make any ſaving Earnings of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. A Man that ſets up a Trade, ought to know the Nature, Worth, and Value of thoſe Goods and Commodities his Calling leads him to trade or deal in, or elſe he may be quickly cheated, and run out of all, by buying counterfeit Goods, or bad Ware: So every Chriſtian muſt know what Goods he is to trade ſpiritually in, as alſo the Nature and Excellency of them. Now the heavenly Commodities are theſe, Faith, Love, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Meekneſs, Temperance, Pardon of Sin, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now he ought to know all theſe Things, the true from the counterfeit. And next unto the Graces of the Spirit, and the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and rare Things he deals in, there are the Ordinances of the Goſpel, the Nature and Uſefulneſs of which he ought alſo to underſtand, and not to be deceived about them, leſt he take the Traditions of Men for Chriſt's Inſtitutions.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. A Man who ſets up a Trade, ought alſo to know who he is to deal or trade with: So ought every Chriſtian; and that is God, through the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him there is no trading to Heaven. 'Tis by him we believe in God, by him we come to the Father. Chriſt is a Saint's only Correſpondent; he receives all our Prayers and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and makes Returns of Mercies.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. A Man who begins a Trade, ought to be well inſtructed, and to know every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Art and Myſtery in it: Some Trades or Profeſſions are hard to learn, they are full of Myſtery, and very intricate; and if they underſtand them not, or are not Crafts-maſters therein they will never live comfortably of them, as Experience commonly ſheweth: So every Chriſtian ought to learn the Myſtery of Godlineſs; this heavenly Calling is not eaſily learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there is no Trade that is more myſterious than the Trade or Art of Godlineſs, as we ſhall fully evince, and make appear,

                     <p>As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſee theſe Scriptures: 1 Cor. 2.7. <hi>But we ſpeak the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery, even the hidden Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9. &amp; 3.3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Without Controverſy great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Godlineſs is twofold, 1. The Doctrinal Part. 2. The Practical Part.</p>
                     <p>A Myſtery is a Thing hidden, hard to find out, that which few underſtand,<note place="margin">Godlineſs a Myſtery.</note> which lies not open to the Sight and Apprehenſion of Men. Many Arts uſed amongſt Men are full of Myſtery. If a Man go into a Chymiſt's Shop, poſſibly he may ſee there ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of Minerals, but he may not know how he extracted thoſe Spirits, nor doth he
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:39531:202"/> underſtand the Nature and Operation of them, that is a Myſtery. There are divers other curious Arts and Devices very hard to learn, they are ſo myſterious; but all come ſhort of theſe heavenly Myſteries. The Myſteries of Godlineſs are exceeding great.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Theſe Things are hidden Things from the Eyes of Men. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. The Goſpel is read daily, every Man hath the Hiſtory of it in his Houſe; but alas! very few underſtand it; 'tis a Myſtery; 'tis not known, but by ſuch only who feel its Power, and bleſſed Effects and Operations of it upon their Hearts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Goſpel, and great Things of Chriſtianity and Godlineſs, are the rare Contrivance of God's eternal Wiſdom,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.1.</note> and therefore full of Myſtery. <hi>If any Man thinks he knows any thing, he knoweth nothing as he ought to know.</hi> Theſe things are not eaſily found out.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and Principles of Chriſtianity and Godlineſs, could not be known without Revelation; had not God afforded us the written Word, what ſhould we,<note place="margin">John 20.31. Rom. 16.25, 26.</note> or could we have known of theſe Myſteries? What do the Heathen know of them, that have not the Holy Scripture? Doth the Light within diſcover the Incarnation, Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt? Doth that teach the Myſtery of Faith and Regeneration? 'Tis true, ſome have affirmed, that they ſhould have known all Things the Goſpel reveals, if they had never had the written Word: But how falſe that is, appears to all; and they themſelves have been ſilenced, by putting one Queſtion to them,<note place="margin">John 20 30.</note> which is this: 'Tis ſaid in <hi>John</hi> 20. <hi>Many other Signs did Jeſus, in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written,</hi> &amp;c. Now let them ſhew us what thoſe other Signs were: But alas! they can tell us nothing but what the Scripture relates; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had we or they known them, but by the Record thereof.</p>
                     <p>That which we have the Hiſtory of, and yet cannot underſtand, or make our own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Spirit of God opens and explains it to us, is a great Myſtery: But we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Myſtery of Religion and Godlineſs, without the Spirit's Teaching and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. As the Hiſtory muſt be revealed by the written Word, ſo the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery muſt be revealed by the Spirit: <hi>For what Man knoweth the Things of a Man, ſave the Spirit of a Man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11.</note> 
                        <hi>which is in him; even ſo the Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which needs or requires ſeveral Gradations and Mediums, to open and explain it from time to time, is a great Myſtery: But the Goſpel, or Myſtery of Godlineſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch ſeveral Gradations and Mediums, to open it unto the Children of Men. (1.) God under the Law revealed theſe Things by divers Sacrifices, Waſhings, and other Rites, whilſt Perſons remained in their Non-age. (2.) It requires the Uſe of divers earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Similitudes, to open and explain it to the Underſtanding of Men. God is compared to a Father, to an Husband-man, to a Judg, to a Creditor, to a Portion, to an Houſholder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt, to a Lamb, to Light, to an Husband, to a Vine, to a Shepherd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Spirit is compared to the Wind, to Oil, to Water: and Grace, to Seed, to Gold tried in the Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Myſteries of Religion and Godlineſs are ſo hard to underſtand in their own Nature, that God condeſcends to open them to us by earthly Things: In this God ſhews what Children we are, and how difficult 'tis for us to underſtand theſe Things. And tho they are thus explained, yet how little is it that we are able to underſtand of them! Now that which the Children of Men are not able fully to take in, or comprehend, tho God makes uſe of the beſt Mediums he in his Wiſdom ſees good to make uſe of, is a great Myſtery: But the Children of Men are able to take in but little of the Myſteries of the Goſpel, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe gracious Mediums God is pleaſed to make uſe of: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That which the Children of Men are not able to take in or receive the knowledg of at once, but when God fees neceſſary to diſcover by degrees, by little and little, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all thoſe proper and fit Mediums he condeſcends to make uſe of, is a great Myſtery: But the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and Godlineſs, God ſees the Children of Men, notwithſtanding all thoſe Mediums he is pleaſed to make uſe of, cannot take in or receive at once, but that there is need for him to open and diſcover them by degrees, by little and little: <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis very myſterious, ſo vaſt a Depth, ſo great a Light, ſo ſtrange a Myſtery is this Myſtery, that God reveals it now a little, and then a little. <hi>Adam</hi> had the firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it: <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpent's Head. Abraham</hi> had more of it made known to him; <hi>Moſes</hi> had a greater Revelation of it than the Prophets: And then, <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who ſaw more than all that went before him, and upon that account was called the greateſt Prophet that ever aroſe amongſt them that were born of Women; and yet he ſaw but a little of this great Myſtery,<note place="margin">Luke 7.28.</note> comparatively to what thoſe ſaw who were in the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpel-Church, after the Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:39531:202"/>6. That which all the wiſe Men of the World, meerly by all their natural Wiſdom, Arts, and Sciences, could never find out, nor arrive at the true knowledg of, is a great Myſtery: But all the wiſe Men of the World, meerly by all their Arts and Sciences, and human Learning, could never arrive to the true knowledg of Chriſt, and real Godlineſs: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Principles of true Godlineſs, and the Myſteries thereof, are out of the reach of meer humane Reaſon; tho not againſt or contrary to Reaſon, yet they lie above Reaſon: Reaſon muſt ſtoop to Faith in theſe things. The Goſpel is called Wiſdom, as oppoſite to the Wiſdom of Men; and the Apoſtle ſaith poſitively, That it was Wiſdom in ſuch a Myſtery, that none of the Princes of this World knew. Nay, the Spirit, ſays one,<note place="margin">Sydenham.</note> jeers all the Learned of the World in this very thing, becauſe of their groſs Ignorance. Where is the Scribe? where is the Wiſe? where is the Diſputer of this World?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Hath not God made fooliſh the Wiſdom of this World?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verſe 18.</note> Hence <hi>the Preaching of the Goſpel was accounted by the learned Greeks but Fooliſhneſs.</hi> Natural Men may underſtand natural Religion; but true Godlineſs conſiſts in the Light of Divine Truth, and in the Life of Grace, God manifeſting himſelf in the Light of Truth, and working the Life of ſupernatural Grace by his Spirit in the Heart. True Godlineſs doth not conſiſt in the Knowledg of the Letter of the Goſpel. A natural Man may have the hiſtorical or notional Knowledg of the Goſpel and Chriſtianity, he may arrive to the moſt exact underſtanding of things, as far as Letters and Words can expreſs them; that is, he may know the true ſence and meaning of things in the Goſpel, according to what either the Hiſtory, or Tenor of ſuch Words will import, and know the Grammatical Sence of Words, better than many true Chriſtians: But this is not the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and true Knowledg of Religion and Godlineſs; for that conſiſts in the ſaving and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Knowledg of God, and Jeſus Chriſt. The Myſtery of the Goſpel, and Power of Godlineſs, is the Diſcovery of God's Glory in it ſelf, and the working of it gloriouſly in the Soul; it lies not in the bare Expreſſion, or Knowledg of Words, nor in the external Form of Profeſſion of theſe Words; but it lies in the Divine Glory of God, which is wrapt up in theſe Words, and the gracious Conformity, Diſpoſition, and Affections of the Soul to theſe things. 'Tis an eaſy matter to confeſs Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, and to read the Scriptures, to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to ſee the Myſtery of that Glory which is in this, that Chriſt is God's Son, and to have the powerful Influences of it upon the Heart, whereby the Soul is brought into the Image or Likeneſs of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection; this is a Myſtery.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That which the moſt wiſe and knowing in the ſame Art or Myſtery, can reach or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand but part of, muſt needs be a great Myſtery: As ſuppoſe a School-maſter, nay, the ableſt in the World, who profeſſes to know and teach ſuch or ſuch an Art or Myſtery, is forced to confeſs, he ſees and knows but little of it, or ſees but in part, 'tis ſo hard and difficult to find out; all would conclude, that Art or Science was a Myſtery indeed: But ſo it is here; for the holy Apoſtles, who had as great a knowledg of theſe Myſteries as any ever had in the World, nay, we may modeſtly conclude, a greater, yet they declare, they knew but in part, and ſaw but in part, they ſaw comparatively but a little way into theſe Myſteries, <hi>For we know but in part. — Now we ſee through a Glaſs darkly.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9, 12.</note> — <hi>Now I know in part. — Ergo,</hi> Theſe are great Myſteries.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That which the holy Angels deſire to pry into, nay, look into with the greateſt Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and Deſire imaginable, and are contented, the better to underſtand, to learn of the Church; and yet, when all is done, do admire, and ſtand as it were aſtoniſhed at, is a great Myſtery: But the Angels do pry into theſe Myſteries with the greateſt earneſtneſs, and are contented to learn of the Church, that they may the better or more fully underſtand them, and after all, ſtand and wonder, to behold the Depth of this Grace, of this Love, and the Strangeneſs of this Myſtery. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Goſpel, or Doctrine of Godlineſs, is a great Myſtery. Now to make this Argument good, pray conſider theſe Texts of Scripture: 1 Pet. 1.12. <hi>Which things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> The word <hi>[deſire]</hi> ſignifies the utmoſt coveting or longing after a thing which a Man cannot be without: <hi>Deſire to look into:</hi>

                        </gap>, this Word ſignifies bowing down to pry heedfully and narrowly into a Thing. 1. The Angels are greatly taken with this Myſtery, with this Grace and Love in Jeſus Chriſt, manifeſted to fallen Man; they look and pry into it,<note place="margin">Exod. 25.20.</note> according as it was typified of them, by the placing of the Cherubims looking down towards the Mercy-Seat. 2. That they are content to learn of the Church, ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. <hi>To the intent, that now unto the Principalities, and Powers in heavenly Places, might be known, by the Church, the manifold Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> 3. That they after all ſtand as it were amazed, and wonder at theſe Depths, ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. — <hi>Seen of Angels,</hi>

                        </gap>, it is not meant of a bare Sight, but a Sight which aſtoniſhes the Underſtanding, and takes up the Heart: <hi>He was ſeen with admiration and wonderment:</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Sibbs.</hi>

                        <pb n="374" facs="tcp:39531:203"/>9, That which the glorified Saints ſhall admire, when they arrive to a perfect Knowledg, muſt needs be a great Myſtery: But the glorified Saints ſhall admire at the Myſtery of this Grace and Love, in the Day of Chriſt, nay, it will be the matter of their wonder to all Eternity. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. Therefore the Doctrine of Godlineſs is a great Myſtery.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. This will be further manifeſt, by conſidering wherein the greatneſs of this Myſtery doth conſiſt.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt;</hi> Now the Myſtery of Godlineſs principally conſiſts in the Perſon of Chriſt, God manifeſt in the Fleſh.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> determined to <hi>know nothing ſo much as Chriſt, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> When we know Chriſt better, we ſhall underſtand this Myſtery better: Chriſt is the Myſtery wrapt up in all the Goſpel, he is the Scope of all the Scripture, the Pearl hid in the Field; every Line is drawn to him, as the proper Center; all the Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows pointed to him, and all the Promiſes run in him. Jeſus Chriſt is really and truly God, and yet very Man, God and Man in one Perſon, and is not this a Myſtery? (1.) Is it not a Wonder, that a Woman ſhould compaſs a Man? (2.) That he that made the World, ſhould be born of a Woman! (3.) That the Ancient of Days ſhould become a Child of a Day old! (4.) That Bleſſedneſs it ſelf ſhould be brought under a Curſe for Sinners! <hi>Chriſt was made a Curſe for us,</hi>

That he who was God over all, ſhould have no where to lay his Head! (7.) That he ſhould become poor, who was ſo rich, and by his Poverty make others rich! is not this a Myſtery? (8.) He by dying deſtroyed Death; and unleſs he had died, we could not live; and by Death he brought us to Life! (9.) And is it not a Myſtery, that a Perſon ſhould be capable to die, and yet by his own Power raiſe himſelf up again from the Dead? (10.) Is not this a Myſtery, that the Phyſician ſhould die to cure his Patient, nay, and unleſs he die, the Sin-ſick Soul could not live; and that his Blood ſhould be the Balſam?

                        <hi>Thirdly;</hi> There is a great Myſtery in Election, in Juſtification, in Sanctification, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, what Branch or Part of the Doctrine of Godlineſs is not full of Myſtery?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly;</hi> There is a Myſtery in every Grace:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In Faith: As, (1.) That a Sinner ſhould believe, <hi>i. e.</hi> go out of himſelf, and be carried above himſelf, to believe Things impoſſible to Man's Senſe, and above his Reaſon, that he ſhould ſeek for Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs and Obedience of another! for a Man (as one would think) to have a great deal of Holineſs, and good Works, and yet to throw it, as it were, all away, and be dead to it in point of Truſt and Dependence! is not this a Myſtery? (2.) To believe, when every thing is oppoſite to it: To work for Life, and to oppoſe ſome Sin, a natural Man is ready to do; but to believe in Chriſt for Life and Holineſs, to relie upon his Doings, his Works and Merits, this the Heart of Map is averſe to; nay, and Satan oppoſeth it, the World mocks at it, and accounts it Fooliſhneſs. (3.) That a Man ſhould believe, and not ſee, nay, believe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>in hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a Myſtery in Love, that a Man ſhould love him with an endeared Affection, with a ſuperlative Love, whom the World can ſee no beauty in; nay, thus to love him, whom their natural Eyes never beheld, nay, love him, who is able to make great, and ſave from all Miſery, and yet ſuffers his People, and beſt beloved Ones, to lie amongſt the Pots, and to be hated and perſecuted in the World, and, to appearance, to be of all Men the moſt miſerable! A Saint knows the Reaſon of theſe Things, but 'tis a Myſtery to others. The Love of Chriſt turns the Affections another way, it drives, as it were, <hi>Jordan</hi> back, it makes the Waters aſcend, and run up hill. Is it not a Myſtery, to ſee a Saint, who hath a
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:39531:203"/> Hundred, nay, it may be, Five Hundred a Year, a gracious Wife, many ſweet and lovely Children, enjoying much Health, and living in all Proſperity; yet if he hath loſt the Light of God's Countenance, or Chriſt be withdrawn from him, he is caſt down, and greatly diſtreſſed and afflicted in his Spirit, and crying out, Ah! what is all that I poſſeſs, ſith I want the Love of Chriſt, the Preſence of Chriſt? what's an Eſtate, and no Chriſt? Wife and Children, and no ſight of Chriſt? Chriſt (ſaith he) is all to me, and all is nothing without him. This is a Myſtery to carnal Hearts, they wonder at it: Nay, to ſee a Man, that hath all the Comforts of the World, expoſe himſelf to cruel Mockings, Loſs of Goods, to Impriſonment, and Death it ſelf for Chriſt's ſake, is a ſtrange thing to worldly Men, they think the Man is mad, 'tis a Myſtery to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly;</hi> The Effects and Operations of Grace and Godlineſs are a Myſtery.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) That God ſhould make Men wiſe, by teaching them to become Fools.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.18.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) That the way to become rich, very rich, eternally rich, is to become poor: This is a Myſtery, yet this Myſtery is taught us in the Perſon of Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> was a King, and very rich, yet cries out, <hi>I am poor;</hi> he was poor in Spirit. This poor Man cried, <hi>There is that maketh himſelf rich, yet hath nothing; there is that maketh himſelf poor,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 13.7.</note> 
                        <hi>and yet hath great Riches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) That the way to have all, is to loſe all; and that a Man gains moſt, when he loſes moſt: Is not this a Myſtery?</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) That Men muſt die to live, or that the way to live is to die; nay, that God kills by making Souls alive, and yet by that killing and death, brings them to life: And is not this a Myſtery? Sin muſt die, and we muſt die to Sin: <hi>Sin revived, and I died;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7.11.</note> yet by that Death he revived, and lived. A Man muſt die to Self, or he can never live himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) God makes Men blind by giving Sight, and turns that Darkneſs into Light; and is not this a Myſtery?</p>
                     <p n="6">(6.) The way to Honour and Exaltation, is to be abaſed, and ſuffer our ſelves to be trod upon; this is opened alſo in the Perſon and Life of Chriſt. To enjoy God's Favour, is firſt to bear his ſeeming Frowns. And many ſuch like Myſteries there are in Godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly;</hi> There is a Myſtery in Ordinances, which thoſe who follow this Trade ſhould underſtand, a Myſtery in Baptiſm, a Myſtery in the Lord's Supper. But theſe things I cannot enlarge upon for want of Room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Let all take heed they do not ſlight or reproach theſe Myſteries.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let them not think to underſtand them in their own fleſhly Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let them labour to get the Power and Operation of them upon their Hearts, and then they will eſteem them, and ſay, there is a Truth in what we affirm and teach.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. He that would drive a Trade to gain by it, or thrive upon it, muſt follow it cloſely, he muſt make it his chief Buſineſs, nothing will be done in it to purpoſe without diligence. So every Chriſtian, who would gain by the Trade of Godlineſs, muſt keep cloſe to it, he muſt follow it day and night, and manage it wiſely, throughout all his other Affairs. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs muſt be followed without intermiſſion, it muſt be every day's Work; the Head, Heart, Hands, Feet, Time, Strength, Diſcourſe Contrivance, muſt be taken up about it. No Man can thrive in Godlineſs, if his Heart be not in it. When thy Hand is in the World, thy Heart ſhould be in Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. He that drives a Trade with diſcretion, muſt take heed he runs not too far in debt, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e keeps his Books carefully, or elſe he may ſoon run out of all: So muſt a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian take heed he run not far in debt. Debts will be contracted: <hi>In many things we offend all:</hi> But be ſure to ſee theſe Debts paid, left the Creditor come on a ſudden upon thee. <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate,</hi> &amp;c. Renew Repentance every day,<note place="margin">1 John 2.3.</note> and labour after freſh Acts of Faith; keep thy Accounts even with God, obſerve the Mercies thou receiveſt from him, and be ſenſible of thy Faults and Miſcarriages.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. There is no Man that follows a great Trade, but ought to ſee he hath a Stock ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to truſt; he that cannot truſt, in ſome Callings, ſhall have but a poor Trade: So every Chriſtian muſt be careful to get a good Stock of Faith and Experience; for if a Saint cannot truſt God, he will never make any Earnings of Godlineſs. It is true, it behoves a Trader to take heed whom he truſteth; ſo it behoveth a Chriſtian; he muſt not truſt his own Heart, nor in his own Righteouſneſs, nor put too much confidence in Princes. We can never truſt Men too little, nor God too much.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. A Man that would follow a Trade to Advantage, muſt be much at home, and keep his Shop, and, as the Proverb is, his Shop will keep him; but he that is more abroad than at home, will ſoon come to Beggery: So a Saint muſt be much at home, and keep his own Heart well. Some Profeſſors are more abroad, ſpying Faults in other Men, than they are in taking notice of their own.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="376" facs="tcp:39531:204"/>X. A Man that drives a Trade, ought to take heed he go not behind-hand, and inſtead of getting, loſe by his Trading: So ought a Saint to take heed he go not backwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of going forwards, and loſe inſtead of gaining. <hi>Thou haſt loſt thy firſt Love. — Remember from whence thou art fallen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and repent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">XI. Some Men trade upon other Mens Stocks, as Factors, Stewards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſuch Traders are Chriſtians, they trade upon Chriſt's Stock, they regulate their Affairs by Chriſt's Advice, they drive on Chriſt's Intereſt. All that Saints have is their Maſter's Money, and it behoveth them ſo to lay it out, that it may bring in the moſt Increaſe. Remember, all your Graces, Gifts, and Temporal Goods too, are the Lord's.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. Some Trades require great Layings out; and if a Man is ſparing in his Layings out, he muſt expect his Comings in will be accordingly: S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the Trade of Godlineſs requires great Layings out. A Chriſtian, who will not lay out his Strength, Time, and Parts, and what he hath, for God, will never grow rich in Faith and Godlineſs.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. Quick Returns are the Life of a Trade, and animate a Man in his Calling and Buſineſs exceedingly: So quick Returns do enliven and greatly encourage a Chriſtian, when he finds God anſwers his Prayers,<note place="margin">Iſa. 65.24.</note> as the Promiſe runs, <hi>Whilſt they ſpeak, I will anſwer,</hi> &amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="14">XIV. Some Men grow very rich by a Trade: So ſome Chriſtians grow very rich in Faith and Experience, by Godlineſs. [<hi>See</hi> City of God, <hi>pag.</hi> 82, 83.]</p>

Clouds are ſaid to be round about the Almighty,<note place="margin">Job 22.14.</note> nay <hi>thick Clouds are ſaid to be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him,</hi> and yet he dwelleth in the Light, which no Man can approach unto: Now when God is ſaid to dwell in Darkneſs, or to have Clouds and Darkneſs round about him, it ſhews that God's Works and Ways are hid from us: ſo that we are not able to ſee him, nor look up to behold what he doth, God's Providences are like Clouds, they obſcure or hide God's Counſel and way of his working from us; he is in the Clouds tho we ſee him not, thoſe Clouds and Darkneſs which are about him do not hinder his ſight of us, tho they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſight of him.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Clouds are of different kinds, ſome are ſaid to be thick and very black, when others have a kind of thinneſs in them, and are, as Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> notes (as it were) tranſparent; ſome are more groſs and opacous, quite hindring and intercepting our ſight of things beyond them: So ſome of God's Diſpenſations are dark, very dark, and others more bright; ſome are ſo dark and gloomy, ſuch black and thick Clouds are over us, that we can ſee no Light, we cannot ſee through them, no ſeeing things beyond them; when others are not ſo dark, they are like light Clouds, the Mind of God may be ſeen and plainly underſtood in them. <hi>Job</hi> was covered with thick darkneſs, he underſtood not the reaſon why God contended with him, he had quite loſt ſight of the Almighty; <hi>I go forward, but he is not there,</hi>

                        <p n="4">IV. Clouds make the day dark, dull, and People very Melancholly: So ſome of God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Providences make the Diſpenſation in which we live very dark and uncomfortable, and fill us with Trouble and Sorrow.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Clouds are at the Commandment of God, he covers the Heavens with them, and again diſſipates and ſcatters them at his Pleaſure: So all the Troubles and Calamities that attend a People or Nation, are brought upon them by the ordering and over-ruling hand of God's Providence: Is there any evil in a City and I have not done it? <hi>Who gave</hi> Jacob <hi>to the Spoil,</hi>

Clouds ſometimes grow thicker and thicker, threatning a diſmal Storm of Thunder and Hail, cauſing all that are in the Field to haſten home: So the Diſpenſations of God's Judgments ſometimes are ſuch, that all God's People fear a dreadful Storm will come upon them; and then thoſe who have ſtrayed abroad, and eſtranged themſelves from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to look about them, and haſten home apace, to take Sanctuary in God.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Clouds cover the Face of Heaven; many Vapours gathering together riſe up and darken the Sun, and keep from us the comfortable Aſpect thereof: <hi>I will cover the Sun with a Cloud.</hi> The ſame Word that is uſed for a Cloud, doth ſignify a Multitude: So Clouds (as Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> obſerves) ſometimes ſignify a Multitude of Men, a Multitude of Enemies, as it was propheſied concerning <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Army, and of the great <hi>Gog, Thou ſhalt aſcend, and come like a Storm, and ſhalt be like a Cloud to cover the Land.</hi>

                        <p>THere is a great Judgment and Terror in Fire let looſe upon a People: So when God brings in Enemies, or lets them looſe upon a People, 'tis a great Judgment, very terrible and amazing.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. There are different Fires: Some are a Judgment, as before; but others are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the Refiner's Fire: So there are different metaphorical Fires. God's Wrath on the Wicked is like a devouring and conſuming Fire, that burns up all; but the Fire in which he puts his own Children, is like the Refiner's Fire. Afflictions and Judgments upon the Godly, are but to burn up their Corruption, and make them more pure; they ſhall not conſume them.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Some Fires break forth ſuddenly and unexpectedly: So ſome Judgments break forth upon a People and Nation ſuddenly, when no Man looks for it, whether it be Plague, Sword, or Famine.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Fire burns terribly; when it hath gotten to a Head, 'tis hard to ſtop it: So when the Wrath of God breaks forth in good Earneſt upon the Wicked, 'tis hard to ſtop it. Tho Wrath hath been quenched by Prayer, yet ſometimes Prayer cannot quench Wrath: <hi>Pray not for this People.</hi>

The Fire will refine Gold, and make it more fit for uſe; but Wood, Hay, and Stubble it conſumeth to Aſhes: So ſincere Chriſtians endure the Fire of Affliction, and are made better by it; but all droſſy Profeſſors and Hypocrites the Fire of Perſecution conſumes.</p>

                     <p>THE Rod hath divers Acceptations:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Shabat,</hi> is taken ſometimes ſtrictly, for a Bough or Sprig growing from the Stock of a Tree, becauſe a Rod or Staff is made of a Bough of a Tree.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It ſignifies a Scepter, the Scepter of a King, an Emblem of Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And becauſe in ancient Times, (as the Learned obſerve) they were wont to make Scepters of ſuch Rods, and all Scepters have the Form or Shape of a Rod; therefore the Original expreſſes the Rod and the Scepter by the ſame Word. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The Scepter, (Shebet,</hi> the Rod) <hi>ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Scepter (ſaith Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi>) denotes two things: (1.) Authority to judg or command, (2.) Power to correct or puniſh.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Word ſometimes refers to Eccleſiaſtical or ſpiritual Diſcipline, or Cenſure of the Church: <hi>Shall I come with a Rod?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Word is often uſed in Scripture to ſignify Puniſhment or Correction, becauſe Correction is often given with a Rod; and therefore to be under the Rod, is to be under Puniſhment or Affliction, <hi>&amp;c. The Rod and Reproof give Wiſdom.</hi> Prov. 29.15. There is a Divine Rod of Chaſtiſement for the Godly, and an Iron Rod of Wrath and Vengeance for the Wicked. And in this Sence the Words are to be taken in the above-cited Texts.</p>
                     <div type="parallels">

                        <p>A Rod puts to pain, if it be ſharply laid on; it makes the Perſon to ſmart, and cry out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Afflictions are grievous and painful to Fleſh and Blood; they wound and pain the outward Man, whilſt the inward Man takes pleaſure in them:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.10.</note> 
                           <hi>I take pleaſure in Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in Reproaches, in Perſecutions, in Neceſſities, in Diſtreſſes for Chriſt's ſake.</hi> Yet in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>No Affliction for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 12.11.</note> As the Spirit would not do thoſe Evils, which the Fleſh would and doth; ſo the Fleſh would not endure thoſe Evils of Sorrows and Afflictions, which the Spirit gladly yieldeth to. As a Believer delights in the Law of God after the inward Man, when the Fleſh is vex'd and troubled at it: So he delights in the Rod after the inward Man, when his corrupt Part is moſt impatient and unquiet under it: <hi>Rejoyce when ye fall into divers Temptations;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.</note> into divers Afflictions. The Fleſh hath its Senſe, and feels Smart; but the Spirit is armed with Faith, which overcomes the Smart. Afflictions were not ſo much as a Rod,<note place="margin">Caryl.</note> if they did not pain, and make ſmart; and we are not ſo much as Chriſtians, if we cannot bear the Smart with Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. A Rod is uſed to correct, not to kill: <q>Affliction is called a Rod, in regard of the Hand that uſeth it; a Sword is in the hand of a Judg, and a Rod in the hand of a Father. God deals with his People, as a Father with his Children, in chaſtizing them. When we offend him, he doth not take a Sword into his hand to ſlay us, but a Rod to ſcourge us.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. A Rod is uſed by a Father, when no other Means will reclaim the Child: So God never afflicts his People, but when he ſees there is need of it, he ſeeing no other Means will do. <hi>He doth not willingly afflict nor grieve the Children of Men.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lam. 3.33.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. A Father hath divers Rods; if one will not do, and make the Child bow, ſubmit, and humble himſelf, another ſhall: So God hath divers Rods; He ſometimes corrects with the Rod of Sickneſs, Loſſes, Croſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes with the Rod of Poverty, ſometimes with the Rod of Deſertion; and ſometimes he uſes the Wicked in his hand, as a Rod to afflict and chaſten his own People, which is one of the worſt of God's Rods; and therefore <hi>David</hi> choſe rather to fall into the immediate Hand of God, than to be ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Rod of the Enemy. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> is called the Rod of God's Anger.<note place="margin">Iſa. 10.5.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. In uſing the Rod, the tender Father always deſigns the Good of the Child: So God in afflicting and chaſtening his People, deſigns their great Good: 'Tis not <hi>for his Pleaſure,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 12.8.</note> 
                           <hi>but our Profit, that we might be Partakers of his Holineſs.</hi>

                        <p>LEt thoſe Chriſtians who are under the Rod, confeſs they have deſerved it; He hath not puniſhed us according as our Sins have merited at his hands.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Let us from hence alſo learn to ſubmit to the Rod, and not ſtrive and ſtruggle with God. O how uneaſy are ſome Men and Women under Affliction. O I could bear, ſaith the Soul, any thing but this. Alas! is it neceſſary that thou ſhouldeſt chuſe thy own Rod? God will correct us with what Rod he pleaſes, according to his good pleaſure it muſt be, for the degree and kind of it too; and are you troubled at the Rod, at this Rod? It may be you had rather God ſhould afflict you ſome other way; but God ſees this is the beſt, and no other will do the work upon your Hearts. It may be, if we had committed ſome other Sins, and not ſuch and ſuch a Sin, we ſhould have been corrected but with ſuch and ſuch Rods, and not with this which ſeems moſt croſs and grievous to us.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Lam. 3 40.</note>III. Let us labour to find out what God ſpeaks to us by the Rod: <hi>Let us ſearch and try our Ways.</hi> Many times we may find out our Sin in the Puniſhment of it.</p>

                        <p n="6">VI. Hear the Rod: <hi>The Lord's Voice crieth to the City, and the Man of Wiſdom ſhall ſee thy Name: Hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Man of Wiſdom is one that fears God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.10. A holy Man is a wiſe Man, and a Sinner is a Fool; Holineſs is the beſt Wiſdom, and Wickedneſs is the greateſt Folly.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. The Man of Wiſdom will hear the Rod. (1.) He will commune with his own Heart, to find out the Cauſe of God's Anger, the Cauſe of Affliction. (2.) He will tremble at God's Judgments. (3.) He will juſtify God under the Rod. (4.) He is one that finds out God's Name in the Rod: He finds out Anger in the Rod, Mercy in the Rod, Wiſdom in the Rod, Power in the Rod, Faithfulneſs in the Rod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. A wiſe Man under the Rod will endeavour to turn away and pacify the Anger of God.</p>
                        <p>There is (it appears) a Voice in the Rod, which a wiſe Man ſtrives to underſtand. (1.) There is a chiding Voice in the Rod. (2.) And not only ſo, but in ſome Rods an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Voice. (3.) A threatning Voice. (4.) An awakening Voice. (5.) A convincing Voice. (6.) There is an humbling Voice in the Rod.</p>

In Winter many things look as if they were dead; Trees, Flowers, and Plants, have no Beauty in them, they are not pleaſant to the Eye: So whilſt the Winter-Time of the Church continues, the bleſſed Trees and Plants of Righteouſneſs ſeem as if they were wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and their Beauty and Glory gone, by means of the Tyranny and Oppreſſion of the Ungodly; but when the Winter is paſt, and the longed for Spring beginneth to appear, they will ſprout up, and flouriſh again gloriouſly.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. In Winter we have now and then ſome good and comfortable Weather: So now and then in the Winter-Time of the Church, there is a ſweet, ſerene, and calm Time of Peace and Tranquillity:<note place="margin">Acts 9.31.</note>

                        <p n="8">VIII. In Winter, Froſts, and cold pinching Weather uſually laſt not long; they are but for a ſeaſon; a Thaw will come: So the afflicted State of a godly Man, tho it be unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, yet 'tis not laſting, to be ſure not everlaſting. Tho ſome Froſts hold longer than others, yet none hold always; Summer will come: And uſually where Winter is fierceſt, Summer for a Recompence is pleaſanteſt.

                        <p>DArkneſs is a Judgment; thick Darkneſs was one of the Plagues of <hi>Egypt:</hi> So ſome Calamities and ſevere Afflictions are brought upon a People or Nation, as a juſt and dreadful Judgment of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Natural Darkneſs is occaſioned by the Abſence of the Sun, and Obſcurity of the other Luminaries of Heaven: So ſome Afflictions and Calamities are occaſioned by the abſence of the Light of God's Word, and hiding of his Face. When the Goſpel is taken away from a People, that People are preſently involved in thick Darkneſs, which is a moſt ſore and fearful Judgment.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Darkneſs is very uncomfortable, 'tis a doleſom thing to have no Light: So to be under ſome Afflictions, eſpecially Deſertion, is the moſt uncomfortable State in the World.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Darkneſs cauſeth a Man to loſe his Way, and wander about, and expoſeth him to many Dangers: So ſpiritual Darkneſs cauſes a Man to ſtumble. <hi>Walk whilſt you have the Light, leſt Darkneſs come upon you; for he that walketh in Darkneſs,</hi>

                           <hi>Tho I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil,</hi> &amp;c. That is, the greateſt Darkneſs and Evil that can befall a godly Man. The Shadow of a Thing in Scripture (ſaith Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi>) denotes the Power of a Thing; and to be under the Shadow of a Thing, is to be under the Power of it: To be under the Shadow of the Almighty, is to be under the Power of the Almighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To be under the ſhadow of Death, is to be under the power and reach of it: Tho I may be ſo near Death, that it may ſeem to others to be really Death, and that it is impoſſible to eſcape Death, yet I will fear no Evil. Some Afflictions threaten Death upon God's People, and upon his Concerns and Intereſt in the World, and Chriſtians may ſeem to be under the Influence of Death. The Influences of Death are thoſe Fears and Doubtings, Diviſions, Diſtractions, and Vexations of Heart and Mind, Cries and Confuſions, which uſually accompany or prepare the Way for Death,<note place="margin">Job 3.5.</note>

                        <p n="7">VII. Darkneſs is more grievous to ſuch as have enjoyed much Light, than to a Man that was born blind; for one that hath had his perfect Eye-ſight, and hath known how ſweet a thing Light is, how ſad and lamentable is it for him to loſe his Sight, or to dwell in Darkneſs! So it is more grievous to a Chriſtian, who hath lived in a Land of Light, and hath long enjoyed the ſweet Favour and Light of God's Countenance, to be deprived of all ſpiritual Light and Comfort, than 'tis to a Perſon, who never knew how ſweet Divine Light, Communion with God, and the Bleſſings of the Goſpel are.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Let Darkneſs be never ſo great, yet God can ſoon expell it, and bring forth Light in the room of it: So 'tis eaſy with God to turn our Night of Sorrow and Affliction, into Light, Joy, and a good Day.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Darkneſs is many times mix'd with Light, ſo that 'tis hard to ſay which is moſt, the Light or the Darkneſs: So ſometimes 'tis with a People, or particular Soul. <hi>But it ſhall be one Day,</hi>

                        <p>A Storm or Tempeſt ſometimes is look'd for and expected, (by certain Signs which ſome obſerve) a conſiderable while before it comes; by the gathering of the Clouds, they ſee a Storm threatned: So the Wrath and Diſpleaſure of God againſt a People, or Nation, is by ſome obſerving Men expected and looked for before it comes. There are certain Signs, which are like the gathering of the Clouds: (1.) When Sin grievouſly abounds. (2.) When the Hand of God hath been lifted up, and yet Sinners are not humbled. (3.) When many faithful and eminent Servants of God are taken away by Death. (4.) When there are ſtrange and wonderful Signs or Prodigies ſeen in the Heavens, or upon the Earth or Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (5.) When the People of God generally, as one Man, do look for it; (for God uſually goes firſt upon the Hearts of his own People in this reſpect.) (6.) When former Afflictions do not humble, nor work Reformation in Profeſſors, and others.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. A Storm comes now and then very ſuddenly, before Men are aware: So doth the Storm of God's Wrath come oftentimes very ſuddenly upon a ſinful Nation and People.

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>WOrmwood properly is an Herb well known amongſt us, upon the account of its exceeding Bitterneſs; hence a common Proverb riſes, <hi>'Tis as bitter as Gall or Wormwood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <div type="parallels">

                        <p>WOrmwood and Gall, and other bitter Things, are phyſical, very good in divers Diſtempers: So Afflictions are good ſpiritual Phyſick; the diſeaſed Soul receives much Profit by them many ways. 1. They purge out the corrupt and noxious Humors of the Soul. 2. They tend to abate and pull down the Tympany of Pride. 3. They are good againſt ſpiritual Deadneſs. 4. They are good againſt ſpiritual Barrenneſs; nothing (when ſanctified) makes a Soul more fruitful. 5. They kill Worms, (as Wormwood naturally doth) principally the Worm of an accuſing Conſcience, that breeds out of the Corruption of the Heart and Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. Wormwood, Gall, or Aloes, are not commonly given alone, but are mix'd with other Ingredients, otherwiſe 'tis hard to take them down: So God mixeth Mercy with Affliction; in the midſt of Judgment, he remembers Mercy towards his own People. <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> ſhall have nothing but Gall and Wormwood, it ſhall be without any Compoſition of Mercy or Pity; hence ſaid to be a Cup without mixture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. Wormwood and Gall are exceeding bitter, and make ſuch things bitter as are given with them, tho ſweet in their own Nature: So Afflictions, eſpecially ſome ſorts of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are very bitter and irkſom to the Fleſh; they alſo make bitter all our earthly Sweets.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> Perhaps ſome may ſay, When are Afflictions ſo exceeding bitter? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When God ſtrikes us in our beſt and deareſt earthly Enjoyments; when he takes away an only Son, a Husband, a Wife; or by a Fire, or otherwiſe, takes away all our earthly Subſtance, ſtripping us quite naked of every thing: Then Afflictions may be ſaid to be bitter, like Gall and Wormwood.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When God brings upon us one Affliction after another: To day thy Cattel are taken away, and then preſently upon it thy Children, by a ſevere Judgment; and after all, thou art ſtruck with a ſore and diſmal Affliction in thine own Body. Thus it was with <hi>Job.</hi> When God deals thus with a Man or Woman, Afflictions may be ſaid to be bitter. But then again,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When God ſtrips a People, or particular Perſon, not only of all their outward Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or earthly good Things, but alſo of all their ſpiritual good Things too, ſuch Things as are dearer to them than their Lives; then Afflictions may be ſaid to be bitter. Should God at once bring ſo ſevere a Stroke upon us, as to deprive us of all our Civil Rights and Privileges, ſuffering an Enemy to break in upon us, who would not regard our good and wholeſom Laws, by which every Man's Propriety is ſecured to him; and not only ſo, but deprive us of the Goſpel, and bleſſed Ordinances thereof, and drive our Miniſters into Corners, or burn them to Aſhes in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and ſet up Popery, and tyrannize it over our Conſciences: This Affliction would be bitter, like Wormwood and Gall, — Which God in Mercy prevent. —</p>
                        <p n="4">4. When Afflictions are very heavy and ſore upon us, and we cannot find out the Cauſe and Ground why God contends with us, then they may be ſaid to be very bitter. It was this which made holy <hi>Job</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 10.2.</note> ſo much diſtreſſed in his Spirit, — <hi>Shew me wherefore thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt with me.</hi> He did not doubt of the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of God in them, but as ſuſpecting ſome Evil in himſelf, as yet unſeen, or not diſcovered to him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. When God afflicts his People, or a gracious Soul, very ſorely for Sin, for this or that Sin, which they know they are, or have been guilty of. O this goes to their Hearts, to think they ſhould provoke their heavenly and dear Father againſt them, to chaſtize them ſo ſeverely.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. When we are under great Afflictions, and God hides his Face, or withdraws himſelf from us, then Afflictions are bitter: This is to be outwardly afflicted, and inwardly too.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <pb n="389" facs="tcp:39531:210"/>7. When Afflictions are laſting, or of long continuance, then they are very bitter. A ſmall Burthen or Weight, born long, will weary a ſtrong Man; but if it be very heavy and abiding, it is much more grievous.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. When God afflicts a Man in Indignation, when he lets flie his tormenting Arrows againſt him, from the fierceneſs of his incenſed Wrath, forcing him to drink off his Cup without mixture, it being all bitter, and no ſweet. Thus God deals ſometimes in a way of Judgment with wicked Men, tho never ſo with his own People, and to ſuch, Afflictions are bitter indeed.</p>

                        <p>FRom hence we may perceive what an Evil Sin is, that God will not ſpare his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they offend him. Sin is a bitter thing, as appears by the Effects of it; Afflictions are many times the Fruits and Effects of Sin.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. It ſhews us alſo, that there is a great difference betwixt the Afflictions and Miſeries of the Godly and the Wicked.</p>

                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay, How may a Chriſtian comfort himſelf, or get ſupport under ſore and bitter Afflictions?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Conſider, that all your Afflictions, tho never ſo bitter, are leſs than your Sins deſerve: <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our Sins, nor rewarded us according to our Iniquities.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Conſider, that tho God chaſtize a godly Man very ſorely, yet it is not in a way of Wrath, to deſtroy him, but contrariwiſe, for his great Good and Advantage.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Conſider, there is not one Dram of Gall in the bittereſt Cup thou doſt partake of, but what God, the moſt wiſe Phyſician, put into it; and if leſs Gall would do, thy Potion ſhould not be ſo bitter. All our Afflictions are proportioned to us by the Almighty, both for kind and quantity.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Conſider, thy Afflictions are not ſo bitter as the Afflictions of many of God's Children were, of whom we read, who were far more worthy and deſerving than thee or I are: What are thy Afflictions compared with holy <hi>Job</hi>'s?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Conſider the bitter Potion Jeſus Chriſt drunk up for thy ſake: He never offended, and yet ſuffered, and his Sufferings were intolerable; no Mortal is able to expreſs the Nature of his Grief and Sorrow. Shall Chriſt ſuffer willingly for us, who ſinned not? and ſhall we be troubled at the bitterneſs of our Sufferings, who are ſo grievouſly defiled with Iniquity, and many times ſuffer for our Sins?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Conſider, that all the Bitter a godly Man meets with, or ever ſhall, will be in this World. As wicked Men have all their Sweet here, and ſhall have nothing but bitter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: So godly Men have all their Bitter here, and ſhall have nothing but Sweet hereafter.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Conſider, how gracious God is to his own Children, in intermixing all their Bitter with Sweet. 'Tis not like the Bitter ſome wicked Men have in this World:<note place="margin">Iſa. 27.7.</note> 
                           <hi>Hath he ſmitten him, as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him? Or is he ſlain, according to the Slaughter of them that are ſlain by him?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Conſider, all the Bitter thou meeteſt with in this Life, will be turned into Sweet.<note place="margin">John 16.20.</note>

Afflictions, like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, put a Man to great Pain.

A Poſt hath Change of Horſes at every Stage, that ſo he may keep upon the ſpeed. 4. He hath Horſes ſtanding ready for change; they are not to fetch out of the Field, or to be made ready, when he comes to his Stage; it is but leaping into the Saddle, and away. 5. He that rides Poſt makes no long Meals, much leſs Feaſts; he takes a Bit, and is gone. 6. He lies not long in Bed, he ſcarce goes to Bed till he comes to his Way's end. 7. A Poſt hath extraordinary Pay for his Service, and that to cauſe him to make the more ſpeed. 8. Sometimes he rides upon pain of Death, with a Halter about his Neck; no Man will loiter when his Life lies on't. 9. All give way to him that rides Poſt; he muſt not be hindred. 10. He ſtays not to ſalute, much leſs, like other Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, to gaze, and view the Country, Towns, Buildings, Gardens, by or through which he paſſeth.</q>

                        <p>AS the Cloud (ſuch a Cloud as you ſee hanging in the Air) is conſumed, or gradually ſpent: So the Days or Life of Man by little and little is conſumed.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. A Cloud comes to its Height, and then is quickly diſperſt, and vaniſheth: So Man ſoon comes to his full Strength, and preſently is gone.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. A Cloud is like a Bottle full of Rain, or Sponges full of Water; God cruſhes theſe Sponges, or unſtops theſe Bottles, and they are emptied, and in emptying vaniſh away, and return no more: So Man, being emptied of Life, vaniſheth away, and returns not again.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> But why then doth <hi>Solomon</hi> affirm the Clouds return again after Rain?<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.2.</note> how then doth <hi>Job</hi> ſay, that the Cloud vaniſheth, ſo Man goeth to the Grave, and returneth no more.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw. Solomon</hi> in that Place of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> gives a Deſcription of old Age, and the ſad Condition of Man in it: he calleth it the evil Day, and wiſhes Men would conſider their latter End, before thoſe evil Days overtake them: <hi>Before the Light of the Sun, Moon,</hi>

                           <hi>and Stars be darkned, and the Clouds return after the Rain.</hi> In old Age the Clouds return after the Rain thus; as in ſome very wet Time, when we think it hath rained ſo much, as might have ſpent and quite exhauſted the Clouds, and drawn thoſe Bottles dry, yet you ſhall ſee them return again, it will rain day after day as faſt as ever: So in old Age, when Rheums dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill ſo freely, that you would think an old Man had emptied himſelf of all, yet the Clouds will return again, and Flouds of watery Humours overflow. Thus the Clouds of old Age return, and in this Senſe the Clouds of the Air return, after they are conſumed and ſpent into Rain.</p>
                        <p>But how doth a Cloud return? not the ſame Cloud numerically, that Cloud which was diſſolved doth not return; the ſame Sun goes down and vaniſheth out of our Sight in the Evening, and returneth in the Morning, the ſame individual and numerical Sun: but that numerical Cloud which vaniſhed, comes not again. Thus Man vaniſheth and returns as the Clouds return after the Rain; that is, after one Generation of Men are dead, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again in their Children, another Generation ſprings up, but there is no other Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Life till the Reſurrection; they that die ſhall not live again here; they ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Houſe; their Place ſhall know them no more.</p>

                     <p>MAN is compared to a fading Flower. There are many Rarities and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in a Flower. 1. Sweetneſs, to pleaſe our Smell. 2. Beauty and Variety of Colour, to affect the Eye. 3. Softneſs affecting the Touch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks not a Word of any of theſe Properties, he ſpeaks not of a flouriſhing but withering Flower; not of its ſpringing up, but of its cutting down, or of its ſpringing up, only in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cutting down.</p>
                     <div type="parallels">

                        <p>A Flower comes up in the Spring, and ſeems very beautiful, but its ſtanding is very ſhort, as you may obſerve in the Cowſlip and divers other Flowers: So Man comes up, but his Abiding here is ſhort, his ſtanding is ſo ſmall, that it is not ſo much as mentioned. We are born to die, and we die as ſoon as we are born; <hi>i. e.</hi> We are in a dying State.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. A Flower is oft-times cut down or cropt off in its budding: So is Man; he comes up like a Flower, and is cut down; he is cut down by Death; Death is the Sithe which cuts down this Flower.</p>

                        <p n="3">III. A Flower, if it be not cut or cropt off, yet it ſoon withers away, and is gone. The very Sun, the Wind, and Air conſumes its Beauty. The Naturaliſts tell us of a Plant, called <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> becauſe it laſts but one Day; as alſo of a Worm, called <hi>Hemerobion,</hi> becauſe it lives but one Day. Such a Plant and Worm is Man. The Heathen Poet gives his Wonder and Obſervation of the Roſe, that it grows old in the very Budding. The Seventy read theſe Words of <hi>Job</hi> in the ſame Tenour, he Decays like a budding Flower; as if Death (ſaith <hi>Caryl</hi>) did riſe early,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.5.</note> and watch for this budding Flower to cut it down. And though ſome of theſe Flowers ſtand till they wither, as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Allegory ſheweth; that is, till gray Hairs: yet all the Time of their ſtanding they have been falling. So that we may well ſay with the Pſalmiſt:<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.15, 16.</note> 
                           <hi>As for Man, his Days are as Graſs: as a Flower of the Field ſo he flouriſheth: for the Wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone, and the Place thereof ſhall know it no more.</hi>

                        <p n="4">IV. The Owner of Flowers knows the beſt Time to crop them, &amp;c. So God knows the beſt Time to crop off or take away by Death any of his choice Flowers. [See more <hi>Man a Flower, pag.</hi> 138, 139.]</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A natural Shadow is a dark Light, cauſed by the coming of ſome thick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy between us and the Sun. This is a Shadow in a proper and ſtrict Acceptation.</p>

                        <p n="2">II. A Shadow is a very uncertain Thing: So is the Life of Man. The Shadow, a Man may be under now, may, before he is aware, be gone.

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">I. Be perſuaded your Days are few. 'Tis eaſy to ſay it, but hard to believe it, and live in the Senſe of it. The Child hopes to be a Man; a Man hopes to be an Old Man; and he that is very old hopes to live yet many Days.</p>

Some do not meaſure their Days by the King's Standard; they meaſure their Days by the Life of their Progenitors. My Father and my Grand-father, ſaith one, lived ſo long, and vvhy may not I live as long as they did? Others meaſure their Days by their preſent Health and Strength; Others by the ſound and healthy Conſtitution of their Bodies.

Let us alſo endeavour to improve the Opportunity of Time; I mean thoſe gracious Advantages God is pleaſed to afford us for the everlaſting Good and Well being of our Souls when Time and Days ſhall be no more. Men of the World take great Care to improve all Opportunities to enrich themſelves, or increaſe their outward Subſtance. They will not loſe their Market-time, nor Change-time, nor Fair-time.

                     <p>DEath is often called a Sleep in the holy Scripture. Sleep is a Figure or Image of Death, a fit Reſemblance of Death; as vvill appear by the follovving Parallels.</p>

                        <p>SLeep is Reſt, or gives Reſt to the Body: So Death is or doth give Reſt to the Body. And hence <hi>Job</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 3.13.</note> ſaith, ſpeaking of Death: <hi>I ſhould have lien ſtill, and been quiet: I ſhould have ſlept, then had I been at Reſt.</hi> We uſually ſay, vvhen a Man goes to ſleep, he goes to reſt. There is a fourfold Reſt vvhich vve obtain in Death. 1. From Labour and Travel; no vvork there. 2. There is a Reſt from Trouble and Oppreſſion: <hi>There the Wicked ceaſe from troubling,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 3.17.</note> 
                           <hi>and the Weary be at reſt.</hi> 3. There is a Reſt from Paſſion and Sorrovv: no Grief ſhall afflict us there. 4. Which is better than all, there is a Reſt from Sin, a Reſt from the Temptations and Drudgery of Satan, a Reſt from the Lavv in our Members.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. In Sleep the vvhole Body reſteth, but many Times the Spirits of ſome Men are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; tho the outvvard Man is at reſt, yet the invvard Man is ſorely diſturbed, vvhereas the Bodies and Spirits too of others are at reſt and quiet: So in the Death of the Wicked, tho their Bodies be at reſt, yet their Souls are tormented. 'Tis the Opinion of ſome Men that the Soul ſleeps vvith the Body, and is vvholly ſenſeleſs of Joy or Myſery until the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. But that doubtleſs is a great Errour: For tho it be granted that many Operations
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:39531:215"/> of the Soul do ceaſe when it departs from the Body, yet the Soul ſleeps not. There are ſome Acts of the Soul which are organical; and there are other Acts which are inorganical, or immaterial. The Organical Acts, that is, whatſoever the Soul acts by the Members of the Body, thoſe Acts muſt needs ceaſe at Death; but the Soul can act of it ſelf without the Aſſiſtance of the Body,<note place="margin">Caryl.</note> as we may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect by many Experiments, while our Bodies and Souls are joined together. How often do we find our Souls at work, when our Bodies lie ſtill and do nothing? When Sleep binds up all our Senſes, and ſhuts up the Windows of the Body cloſe, that we can neither hear nor ſee? yet then the Soul frames to it ſelf, and beholds a thouſand various Shapes, and hears all Sorts of Sounds and Voices; the Soul then ſees, and hears, and deviſeth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth, grieves, rejoices, hopes, fears, chuſeth, and refuſeth: all this the Soul doth in Dreams and Viſions of the Night, when deep ſleep falls upon Man. What Meditations have ſome good Men had in their Sleep! they have had Scriptures wonderfully opened to them, and have been grieved when they waked to find the Matter gone from them. God ſeals up Inſtruction ſometimes to his People in their Sleep. Alſo in Ecſtaſies and Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Body is, as it were, laid by as uſeleſs and uninſtrumental to the Soul. <hi>I knew a Man in Chriſt fourteen Years ago,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>whether in the Body I cannot tell,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.2, 3.</note> 
                           <hi>or out of the Body I cannot tell, God knoweth,</hi> &amp;c. Now if the Soul was not capable of a Separation from the Body, and in that ſeparated State capable of ſuch divine Raviſhments, <hi>Paul</hi> might eaſily have reſolved the Caſe and ſaid, he was taken up in the Body, but he could not tell whether the Soul acted with his bodily Organs, or without them. He had mighty Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Soul, his Spirit wrought ſtrangely, and then took in ſuch Revelations of God and from God, as his bodily Organs could never faſhion into Words, or repreſent by Speech. He heard <hi>(quae fando explicari à quoquam homine non poſſunt) unſpeakable Words,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Beza.</note> 
                           <hi>which it is not lawful</hi> (or poſſible) <hi>for a Man to utter.</hi> The Soul hath an Ear to hear ſuch Words that the Body cannot find a Tongue to expreſs. So <hi>John,</hi> in his divine Raviſhment, ſaith: <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day:</hi> as for his Body that was, as to that Buſineſs, laid aſide and ſuſpended as uſeleſs in that Day, and his Spirit called up to that angelical Work, <hi>viz.</hi> the receiving of Viſions and Revelations from on high, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as the Souls of good Men, whileſt they are in this World in Sleep, and in Trances, or Ecſtaſies, are capable of ſuch glorious Raviſhments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So when their Bodies dy or fall aſleep, their Souls are with Chriſt in Heaven: and the Souls of the Wicked they go into Chains of Darkneſs, Torment,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.22, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </note> and Miſery. <hi>The rich Man died, and was buried, and in Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in Torment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. Sleep is not perpetual; we ſleep and wake again: So tho the Body lie in the Grave, yet Death is but a Sleep as it were; the Man will awake and riſe again.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The going to ſleep, and ſleeping of ſome Men, greatly differs from others: So the Death of the Saints greatly differs from the Death of the Wicked</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the Preparation the one makes to go to reſt over what the other doth. Some go to ſleep before their Work is done: So ſome die before their Work is done. As no Saint dies before his Work is done: So there is no wicked Perſon that dies, but he dies or goes to ſleep before his Work is done. This is our Working-day; when the Sun of our Life is ſet, no more Work can be done. <hi>The Time comes,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>when no Man can work.</hi> All a Godly Man's Care is to be ready, when Night comes, to go to reſt. But the Wicked take little Thought about it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Some Men fall aſleep in an hurry of Buſineſs, and in great Diſtraction, when others in a ſweet Manner lay their Heads down upon their Pillows: So ſome wicked Men die in great Diſtraction and under ſad Horrour of Conſcience, when many a Godly Man dies in a ſweet and heavenly Manner, declaring to all he hath nothing to do but to die.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Some Men dread the Thoughts of going to ſleep, for that it is dangerous in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for ſome Perſons to ſleep: So ſome wicked Men dread the Thoughts of Death, like him who cryed out, <hi>I am ſo ſick I cannot live, and ſo ſinful that I am afraid to die:</hi> But moſt Godly Men are delivered from the Fear of Death, they go willingly to Bed:<note place="margin">Luk. 2.29.</note> 
                           <hi>Now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace,</hi> &amp;c. Saints are many times willing to go to reſt, becauſe they are quite wearied out. (1.) Sin wearies them, and even wares them out, and makes them groan. (2.) The World wearies them, and makes them willing to go to Bed.<note place="margin">Eccl. 5.12.</note> (3.) The Devil, the God of this World, wearies them with his Temptations. (4.) Their bodily Weakneſſes and diſquieting Pains wearie them. (5.) The Abſence of Chriſt alſo makes them willing to go home.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Some Men fall aſleep in a dangerous Place, nay, and ſometimes in the midſt of their Enemies: So wicked Men die in a dangerous Place, being far from God, and out of the Covenant of Grace, and beſides are ſurrounded about with evil Angels, who ſtand ready to devour their Souls: But a godly Man falls aſleep in Jeſus. O that's a ſweet Place to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:39531:216"/> ſleep in. (1.) He ſleeps in the view of Jeſus; Chriſt knows his Grave, and will preſerve his Duſt. (2.) He falls aſleep in the Love of Jeſus. (3.) He falls aſleep in the Covenant of Jeſus. <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Some Mens Sleep is much more ſweet and comfortable than others, (as we ſhewed before) ſome Mens Sleep is very troubleſom, their Spirits are troubled: So the Death of the Godly is ſweet, they have Peace and heavenly Joy, being with Chriſt; but the Death of the Wicked is troubleſom, their Spirits being in Torment, whilſt the Body lies in the Grave. I might alſo ſhew you the great Difference there ſhall be in the awaking of the one, and the other; but that I will leave to its proper place.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. A Man that is aſleep, taking his natural Reſt, may be eaſily awakened, and called up by the Power of Man: So the Body, when it is dead, can with infinitely more eaſe be raiſed up by the Power of God; 'tis but a Call from Heaven, and we are awakened out of the Duſt: <hi>The Day is coming, when all that are in the Grave ſhall hear his Voice, and come forth,</hi> &amp;c. John 5.28.</p>

                        <p>WHat a bleſſed Condition are Believers in! They are not only happy whilſt they live, but ſhall be bleſſed when they die; their Bodies have not only quiet Reſt, but their Souls alſo reſt in Peace and Quiet.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It may ſtir up all Chriſtleſs Souls to labour after an Intereſt in the Lord Jeſus; for if they are not in Chriſt whilſt they live, they are not like to fall aſleep in Chriſt when they die.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We may learn alſo from hence, what little ground there is for a godly Man to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to die, when his Work is done: Are any unwilling to go to ſleep at Night, that have laboured hard all Day?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Let us labour hard whilſt the Day laſts, whilſt we have Health and Life, that we may have done our Work, and be ready to go to ſleep.</p>

                        <p>DEath, we have already ſhewed, is called a Sleep; and after a Man hath had his full Sleep, he awaketh: So when the Dead have lain their full Time appointed by the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Grave, they ſhall be quickned, and come to life again.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Some fall into ſuch a ſound Sleep, that they muſt (when there is occaſion for it) be awakened: So the Dead are fallen into ſuch a faſt or ſound Sleep, that they muſt be awakened:<note place="margin">John 5.28.</note>

                        <p n="4">IV. There is a great difference between one Man's awaking out of Sleep, and anothers; ſome are awakened before they are willing, and ariſe up with great horror and amazement; when others awake in a ſweet, peaceable, and quiet manner, &amp;c.

                        <p n="3">3. The Godly ſhall awake with glorious Robes upon them, fit for the Conſummation of their Marriage with the Lamb, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: But the Wicked ſhall awake in a poor, miſerable, and naked Condition: What Robes ſhall they have on, unleſs they be the filthy Rags of their own Righteouſneſs, with which they were cloathed, whilſt they lived in this World?</p>

                        <p n="2">II. That which Men ſow, that alſo they reap: they do not ſow Beans, and reap Barley; nor ſow Tares, and reap Wheat: So the very ſame that all Men in a ſpiritual Senſe ſow,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> they ſhall reap; They that ſow to the Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption; and they that ſow to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life everlaſting.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. According to the Quantity that every Man ſows, ſo they reap; He that ſows ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or but a little Seed, muſt expect to reap ſparingly, or have but a ſmall Crop: So they who do much Service for God, or ſcatter liberally abroad to his People in this World, ſhall receive much from the Hands of God at the End of the World; and he that doth but little for God, tho he doth it in Sincerity, muſt expect to reap accordingly in that Day.

                     <p>THE Reſurrection-Day is the Saints Marriage-Day; this is their eſpouſal-Day: For <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.12.

                        <p>THere is, or ought to be, a moſt endeared Love in thoſe Parties who intend to marry one another. Nay, they, before the Marriage-Day, mutually give up themſelves one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſometimes in a ſolemn Manner before Witneſſes they are eſpouſed —: So the Soul of a Believer is ſpiritually united to Jeſus Chriſt whilſt in this World. A Saint loves Chriſt dearly, and Chriſt a Saint. Nay, and in Baptiſm, in a moſt ſolemn and ſacred Manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Witneſſes, the Soul is publickly eſpouſed to the Lord Jeſus; and in the Day of the Reſurrection ſhall be the Solemnization of the ſacred Marriage.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The Marriage-Day is much longed for by thoſe who in hearty Affection are eſpouſed to one another: So the Godly long for that Day, when the ſpiritual Marriage ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated between Chriſt and them.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Bride in the Marriage-Day is uſually richly adorned; if a Princeſs, or a Perſon of a noble and honourable Deſcent, ſhe is excellently clad and adorned with rare and coſtly Jewels, that the Bridegroom may take the more Delight in her: So the Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently every Godly Chriſtian, ſhall in the Day of the Reſurrection be moſt richly cloathed with Robes of Immortality.<note place="margin">Rev. 19.7.</note>

                           <hi>and to her was granted, ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine Linen, clean and white,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The King's Daughter is all glorious within: her Cloathing is of wrought Gold, ſhe ſhall be brought to the King in Raiment of Needle-work,</hi> &amp;c. Some by theſe white and glorious Robes underſtand the imputed Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: Others, the Righteouſneſs of Sanctification: Some others conclude they are both intended, and not only ſo, but alſo thoſe heavenly Robes, with which the Bodies of the Saints ſhall be clothed in the Day of the Reſurrection, which none are able to deſcribe: however, all conclude the Church in that Day ſhall ſhine forth ſo in Glory and Beauty, that Men and Angels ſhall admire her. No Bride ever appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſuch Splendor, or ſo richly clothed and adorned, as the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, ſhall when the Marriage of the Lamb is come.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. In a Marriage-Day the Bride and Bridegroom have a full and perfect enjoyment of each other; and there is nothing in the World wherin there is ſo full communication of one Creature to another (ſaith Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>) as there is in that Condition of Marriage: So in the Day of the Reſurrection, when the Church ſhall be married to the Lord Jeſus, the Godly ſhall have a full and perfect Enjoyment of him, whom they ſo dearly love.

                        <p>LAbour to be fully eſtabliſhed in the Truth of the Reſurrection; ſee that no Man deceive you, 'tis a perilous Age. And to confirm doubting Chriſtians in this great Principle of the Chriſtian Religion, take a few Arguments.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If the Dead riſe not: Then Chriſt is not riſen from the Dead.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.16, 20.</note> But Chriſt is riſen from the Dead. Therefore the Dead ſhall riſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That Doctrine that makes Preaching vain, is a falſe and pernicious Doctrine: But ſuch who deny the Reſurrection, make Preaching vain.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.14. &amp; 15.2.</note> Therefore a falſe and pernicious Doctrine.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If the Dead riſe not: Then thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Jeſus, are periſhed.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.18.</note> But thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt, are not periſhed. Therefore the dead ſhall riſe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If the Dead riſe not: Then the Godly are of all Men moſt miſerable.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.15, 19.</note> But the Godly are not of all Men moſt miſerable. Therefore the dead ſhall riſe.</p>
                        <p>Obj. <hi>The Soul of a Child of God at Death is happy and with Chriſt, and ſhall be for ever, whether the Body riſe or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore they are not of all Men moſt miſerable, unleſs the Soul be mortal and die with the Body, as ſome affirm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Life of the Soul, as well as of the Body, depends wholly upon Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and if Chriſt be not riſen, we are yet in our Sins: and therefore this makes nothing either to prove Saints happy without a Reſurrection, or for the mortality of the Soul.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If the Saints of God in the primitive time, did believe and were well grounded in the Truth of the Reſurrection: Then the Dead ſhall riſe. But the Saints of the Primitive time did ſo believe, and were ſo eſtabliſhed. <hi>Ergo.</hi> See theſe Scriptures;<note place="margin">Joh. 11.24. 1 Cor. 15.22, 23. Ver. 52.</note> 
                           <hi>I know he ſhall riſe again, in the Reſurrection at the laſt day: For as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: but every Man in his own order, Chriſt the firſt Fruits, and afterwards they that are Chriſt's at his coming: for the Trumpet ſhall be ſounded, and the Dead ſhall be raiſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again; even ſo thoſe which are fallen aſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi>

As to be ſhut up in Spiritual Darkneſs, is a ſeparation from God, as to his Preſence in a way of Grace: So to be ſhut up in the thickneſs and blackneſs of the darkneſs of Hell, is an eternal ſeparation from God, and the enjoyment of him for ever: when once he ſhall ſay <hi>[Depart from me]</hi> there is a ſeparation from all Joy and Happineſs, <hi>[Ye curſed]</hi> there is a black and direful Excommunication. <hi>[into Fire],</hi> there is the Extremity of pain, <hi>[everlaſting],</hi> there is the Perpetuity of the Puniſhment, <hi>[prepared for the Devil and his Angels],</hi> there are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal tormenting, and tormented Company. And to encreaſe the horror and amazement of the Damned, this Fire ſhall only torment them, not give them any Light, but they ſhall be caſt out into utter Darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</p>

Men may be in Darkneſs ſpiritually, and they may be enlightned and ſaved through Grace, but to be caſt out into the dark and diſmal Gulf of Hell, it totally and everlaſtingly deprives of any uſe of Means, for enlightning any more for ever, Goſpel-Light ſhines not at all in that dark and diſmal Region, becauſe they hated the Light thereof in this World, they muſt now be caſt out into utter Darkneſs in the World to come.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Men may be in Darkneſs, and yet enjoy many other Comforts, tho they be deprived of Light: But the Damned in Hell are not only in black and thick Darkneſs, but are alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of any other Comfort: As they ſee nothing but Darkneſs, ſo they hear nothing but diſmal Screeches, and amazing dreadful Crys, and gnaſhing of Teeth.</p>

                        <p n="2">II.

                  <p>As touching the Miter, or Bonnet upon the Prieſt's Head, made of blew Silk, and fine Linnen, like to an half Coronet, beautified with a Golden Plate, on which was written Holineſs to the Lord. 1.

               <head>The Tabernacle, and what it was the Type of.</head>
               <p>THe Tabernacle in ſome reſpect, according to the Learned, was a Type of Chriſt's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was exceeding glorious within, all the inward parts thereof were overlaid with pure Gold. This might ſignify how the Human Nature of the Son of God was covered with the Diety; that being the true Tabernacle that God hath pitched, and not Man. Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, The Word dwelt (or tabernacled) amongſt us, (ſpeaking of his being in our Fleſh) or taking upon him our Nature, it being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and not erected by Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Tabernacle was the place where God met with his People; now God meets with his People in Chriſt 'tis in and through him, we come to know or have the true Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Will, and enjoy his gracious Preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe who would be accepted with God, and worſhip him aright, muſt wait at the door of this Spiritual Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Others underſtand by the Tabernacle, the Church, or Myſtical Body of Chriſt, wherein God graciouſly dwells, and hath promiſed alſo to meet his People.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:39531:228"/>1. It was moveable, ſignifying the troubleſome State of God's People, whilſt they paſs through the Wilderneſs of this World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Tabernacle had three places. 1. The outward Court, wherein ſtood the brazen Altar. 2. The Holy Place. 3. The Holieſt of all. In the firſt, it typifies forth the viſible or outward Form of the Church, in reſpect of the external Exerciſe of Religion and Worſhip, hither the common People may come. The ſecond typified out the Spiritual State, or more cloſe and holy Fellowſhip of the Church, which none have admittance into, but ſincere and ſanctified Perſons, who feed upon the Spiritual and true Shew-Bread, Jeſus Chriſt. The third typified Heaven it ſelf, or the Church of God triumphant, where Chriſt is ſet down in Glory, at the Father's right hand, to intercede for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Entry to the Holieſt of all, was by the Holy Place, and to the Holy place, was by the outer Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So our Entry into Heaven, is by being Members of the viſible Church, through Faith, and a good Conſcience. He that would enter into the Holieſt of all, muſt firſt be Holy; and he that would come into a State of true Holineſs, and Communion with God and his People, muſt learn to know where the Candleſtick and true Shew-Bread ſtands, which is the viſible Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You read of the fixed Pillars of the Holy Place; they might ſignify the Holy Apoſtles of Jeſus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>THe Ark was an aſſurance of God's Preſence amongſt his People: So Chriſt is the Cauſe and Aſſurance, that God in a gracious way is preſent with us.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Where the Ark was, there it was lawful to offer Sacrifice, and no where elſe: which might ſhew that our acceptance in God's Sight, is through Jeſus Chriſt. If Chriſt dwell not in our Hearts by Faith, if we have not the Ark with us, Chriſt with us, God will not accept of our Prayers nor Service.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In the Ark was the Pot of <hi>Manna;</hi> to ſhew, that in Chriſt is the Life, Comfort, and Spiritual Nouriſhment for our Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Ark had a Crown of Gold round about it; ſignifying the Majeſty of Chriſt's Kingdom, or his Regal Power.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The two Tables were in the Ark, the Ark kept them: which might ſignify Chriſt's keeping the Law perfectly for us, and deliver us thereby from the Curſe of it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. When the Ark was ſet in the Temple of <hi>Dagon, Dagon</hi> fell down and broke to pieces: So when Chriſt, and his Truth, are ſet up in a Man's Heart, or a Nation, Sin and Idolatry will go down.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Where the Ark was, there was the Glory of God; and when that departed, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God departed: So where Chriſt's bleſſed Truth and Goſpel is, there is the Glory of God, but when Chriſt leaves a People, takes away his Goſpel, the Glory of God goes from that People.</p>
               <p>Some run a Parallel between the Church and the Ark; others between the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God and it: But in my Judgment, it more clearly was a Type of Chriſt, which may comprehend much of what they ſay in reſpect of other things.</p>

This will appear in five Things: (1.) In the Choice of the Sacrifice. (2.) In the preparing of it. (3.) In the Effuſion of the Blood, and Actions about it. (4.)

                  <p n="1">I. In the Choice of the Sacrifice, the Lord appointed it to be a Lamb; notably ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Baptiſt called, the <hi>Lamb of God, taking away the Sins of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. It was to be a Lamb without blemiſh; ſignifying the moſt abſolute Perfection of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The Paſchal Lamb was to be taken out of the Fold; ſignifying, that Chriſt ſhould be <hi>taken from amongſt Men,</hi> or, <hi>from among his Brethren,</hi> Deut. 17.15. one of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The Lamb was to be a Year old, and alſo it muſt be ſlain; ſignifying, that Chriſt in his full vigour and ſtrength ſhould be put to death.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The Lamb was to be roaſted with Fire; which might ſignify the Manner of Chriſt's Death: He was crucified and pierced; he endured the Fire of Afflictions, and the Fire of God's Wrath, that was due to us for our Sins.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The Lamb was roaſted whole; to ſignify, ſaith Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> that Chriſt bore the whole Wrath of God, both in Soul and Body. Not a Bone of the Lamb was to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; to ſhew, that not one Bone of Chriſt ſhould be broken. <hi>John</hi> 19.36.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The Blood of the Lamb was to be ſaved in a Baſon; it muſt not be ſhed upon the Ground, nor trodden under foot; ſignifying the Preciouſneſs of Chriſt's Blood, and that great Eſteem God the Father, and all true Chriſtians have of it.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. The Blood of the Lamb muſt be ſprinkled upon the Lintel, and Sides of the Doors of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> which held forth, that the Blood of Chriſt muſt be applied by Faith; for our Juſtification ſtands not only in the ſhedding of Chriſt's Blood, but alſo in the ſprinkling of it upon our Conſciences.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. It muſt be ſprinkled upon the Poſts and Doors, ſo as the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> could neither go out of Doors, nor come in, but they muſt ſee on all ſides the Blood of the Lamb; ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they and we ſhould, both at home and abroad, going forth, and coming in, and on all occaſions, have the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt before our Eyes, in holy Meditation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>

It was not enough for the Jews to have the Lamb ſlain, and the Blood ſhed within the Houſe, but the Blood muſt be ſprinkled without Doors; ſignifying (as ſome obſerve) If Chriſt's Blood, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Merits of it,) be received into our Hearts for Juſtification, the ſprinkling of it will appear, and be ſeen outwardly in a holy Life, and real Sanctification.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Verſe 22.</note>XI. The Blood of the Lamb was to be ſprinkled with a Bunch of Hyſſop dipp'd in it, which might ſignify, that ſuch who would be ſprinkled with Chriſt's Blood muſt obtain true Faith; for Hyſſop bears a Reſemblance to Faith in threee things: (1.) It is a ground, low, and weak Herb: Faith in it ſelf, and as it is in Believers, is weak, and teacheth Humility. (2.) It will grow on a Rock or Wall: So Faith roots it ſelf in Chriſt, that true ſpiritual Rock. (3.) Hyſſop hath a cleanſing and healing quality: So Faith purifies the Heart and Life of a Sinner, and heals all the Sores of a wounded Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. They were to eat the Fleſh of the Lamb; to ſignify, that we muſt ſpiritually feed upon Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> believe on him, which is called an eating of his Fleſh, and drinking of his Blood.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. Every particular Lamb was to be eaten in one Houſe; ſignifying the Unity of the Church of God, or the ſpiritual Conjunction and Agreement of all the Faithful, in one Bread, and one Body.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. Only <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and not Strangers, were to eat of it; to ſhew, that none but the true Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers, have Right to Chriſt, and the bleſſed Rites of his Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. They were to eat it with bitter Herbs; to ſignify, that Repentance and godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin, ought to be in thoſe who come to receive and partake of Jeſus Chriſt, and that they ſhould remember with Grief of Soul what their Sins brought upon their Saviour, and what the filthy and bitter Nature of Sin is.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. They were to eat it with unleavened Bread; to ſignify that thoſe who come to the true Paſſeover, ſhould keep that Feaſt with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth, hating falſe Doctrine, Hypocriſy, and every evil Work.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. They muſt eat it in remembrance of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> So thoſe who come to the true Paſſeover, ought to remember how God hath by Chriſt's Blood deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them from Wrath and Hell.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. They were to eat it with their Loins girt, and their Staves in their hands, and their Shoes on their Feet; to ſhew, that we who feed upon our Paſſeover, ſhould have the Girdle of Truth, and our Feet ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace, and that we are but Strangers and Pilgrims here.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. They were not to eat the Paſchal Lamb, until they had purged all Leaven out of their Houſes; which ſhews what Care every Chriſtian ſhould take, to purge out the Leaven of Malice and Wickedneſs out of their Hearts. The <hi>Jews</hi> were to ſearch for Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not ſuffer a Crum or ſmall Morſel to remain in their Houſes: So careful ſhould all thoſe be to purge out every Sin, and let no Iniquity remain in them, who come to the Lord's Table.</p>
                  <p>WHEREIN the Brazen Serpent was a Type of Chriſt, as alſo the <hi>Manna,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others Types, we have ſhewed in the <hi>Firſt Volume:</hi> And the Parallels of the Firſt and Second Temple, we have inſiſted upon under the Head of Metaphors concerning the <hi>Church of God,</hi> to which we refer you.</p>
                  <p>And finding to what a Bigneſs this Second Volume is ſwollen, I muſt be forced to break off, and leave theſe my poor Labours to the Bleſſing of God, praying they may prove to the Advantage of his deſpiſed and afflicted Church; deſiring, what Profit any Chriſtians may receive here-from, they would not forget to give the Honour to God, who only deſerves it: to whom be Glory in the Church, by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all Ages, World without End. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Rom. 14.4.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another Mans Servant? to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth:</hi> as if he had ſaid, There is but one Lord of all, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> To him he ſtands, if he be firm in Faith; to him he falls, if he ſins, as thou ſuſpecteſt: He has the Prerogative and Power of judging in himſelf, but thou haſt not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whereas he had made mention of his Fall, he immediately adds the Correction, <hi>He ſhall be held up, for God is able to make him ſtand;</hi> that is, to clear up all ſuſpition of Evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So in thoſe Phraſes where the denial of the Affirmative is ſubjoyned, where nevertheleſs the Denial is rather to be underſtood comparatively, or reſpectively, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.32.<note place="margin">John 16.32.</note>

                  <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me:</hi> he ſpeaks of Spiritual Life, which he attributes not to himſelf, but to Chriſt the Prince of Life, as the ſupream Author and Cauſe of it: ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.</p>

                  <p>An <hi>Analogical Accommodation</hi> (which <hi>Cajetan</hi> called a tranſumptive ſenſe) is when the words of the Old Teſtament are uſed in the New, and accommodated to the Event, and for Conveniency or Similitude are attributed to a Perſon or ſome certain thing, extending it beyond the ſcope the firſt holy Writer; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.35. the ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.2. <hi>I will open my Mouth in a Parable, I will utter dark Sayings of old;</hi> is analogically ſaid to be fulfilled in Chriſt: For, as God the Father by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets opened the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven to his People at all times; ſo Chriſt who was, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, both which agree in this, that they are called <hi>Parables,</hi> that is, Similitudes, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are brought in by Chriſt, and recited by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> on purpoſe to admoniſh the People by thoſe Examples, of what they were to expect from God by their Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in, or Apoſtacy from the Faith: See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6, 11, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The words <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.4. viz. <hi>He hath born our Griefs</hi> (or Infirmities) <hi>and carried our Sorrows</hi> (or Diſeaſes) are cited <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.17.

                  <hi>Article V.</hi> Of an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Type, and its firſt Diviſion.</head>
               <p>AN <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Type is the myſtical Senſe of Scripture, whereby things acted or done in the Old Teſtament, (eſpecially what reſpected the Prieſthood and Worſhip of the Jews) prefigured and adumbrated things acted in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-times, with reſpect eſpecially to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Antitype,</hi> who is, as it were, the <hi>Kernel</hi> incloſed in all thoſe Shells of Old-Teſtament-Ceremonies, Types or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may be thus diſtinguiſhed, (1.) that like an <hi>Allegory,</hi> it is either <hi>innate,</hi> (or natural) or <hi>inferr'd.</hi> The <hi>Innate</hi> is that which is expreſly delivered in the Scriptures, or when the Scripture it ſelf ſhews or intimates, that ſome Ceremony, or thing tranſacted, does adumbrate the things related or done in the New-Teſtament,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39531:251"/> eſpecially Chriſt in a myſtical ſenſe. This is done, either <hi>expreſly</hi> and implicitely, or <hi>tacitely</hi> and implicitely; or, which is all one, the Scripture either ſhews it <hi>expreſly,</hi> or <hi>tacitely</hi> inſinuates the thing tranſacted to be a Type of Chriſt: Of the firſt kind we have many Examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Examples of Types.</note>The Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> was <hi>ſwallowed into the Whales Belly,</hi> and vomited out after three days (as <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.17. and 2.10.) this is a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who lay three days in the Grave, and of his glorious Reſurrection, as Chriſt himſelf expreſly ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40. &amp; 16.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.29, 30.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> by Divine Command lifted up in the Deſart, againſt the bitings of Serpents, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.8, 9. is expreſly ſaid to be a <hi>Type</hi> of Chriſt, who was lifted up upon the Croſs, and healing Believers of the biting of the Infernal Serpent; <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15.</p>
               <p>The Conſtiution and Sacrifice-Offerings of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood in the Old Teſtament, did typically prefigure Chriſt the High-Prieſt, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. and the following. More Examples may be found upon a diligent ſearch and Meditation of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Examples of the latter ſort are theſe: The <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mercy-Seat.</note> or the <hi>Covering</hi> of the Ark of the Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.17. which typified <hi>Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 3.25. ſo you may compare <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1, &amp;c. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.8. that the <hi>Manna</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) which is a Continuation of Tropes, eſpecially Metaphors; of this Mind is <hi>Azorius, Gillius, Morton;</hi> but this is not right, for ſeveral Reaſons ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the learned <hi>Glaſſius,</hi> p. 440. to which we refer. A Parable, according to <hi>Jerome,</hi> is <hi>a Compariſon made of Things differing in Nature under a certain Similitude. Varinus</hi> deſcribes it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: i. e. <hi>A Parable is a Compariſon, ſignifying a Similitude in order to explain, or make the Things treated of perſpicuous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We define or deſcribe a Parable thus: <hi>A Parable is a Similitude or Compariſon, by which ſome certain Affair or Thing is feigned, and told, as if it were really tranſacted,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39531:255"/> and is compared with ſome ſpiritual Thing, or is accommodated to ſignify it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Parable differs from an Hiſtory, (1) with reſpect to the Object: for Hiſtory is a Narrative of Things really done, but a Parable only of a Thing feigned, and adapted to inſtruct, which yet is not a Lie, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well ſays, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Quaeſt. Evang. q.</hi> 41. <hi>Non omne quod fingimus mendacium eſt, ſed quando id fingimus quod nihil ſignificat, tunc eſt mendacium. Cum autem fictio noſtra refertur ad aliquam ſignificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, non eſt mendacium, ſed aliqua figura veritatis. Alioquin omnia, quae à ſapienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; ſanctis Viris, vel etiam ab ipſo Domino figuratè dicta ſunt, mendacia deputabuntur, quia ſecundum uſitatum intellectum non ſubſiſtit veritas in talibus dictis.</hi> Hence <hi>Horace</hi> ſays,
<q>Ficta voluptatis cauſâ ſunt proxima veris.</q> And if Fables, accommodated to teach or inſtruct, are not Lies, much leſs are Parables.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ with reſpect to uſe; An <hi>Hiſtory</hi> gives you a plain ſimple Narrative. A <hi>Parable</hi> does not only tell a Thing as if really done, but has withal ſome refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſome other Thing in order to inſtruct, either implicitely or explicitely.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Parable</hi> differs from an <hi>Example,</hi> which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For an <hi>Example</hi> is but Part of an Hiſtory, when a Thing, rightly done, is defended or juſtified from Inſtances or Practice of the like Thing done before: or when a Thing ill done is demonſtrated by a like Example. Thus Chriſt excuſes his Apoſtles when accuſed for plucking the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. by the Example of <hi>David</hi>'s eating the Shew-bread, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.6. compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.41, 42. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.1, &amp;c. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.29, 30, &amp;c. where you have the Parable of him that <hi>fell among the Thieves.</hi> See alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.19. the Parable of the <hi>Rich Man and Lazarus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Diviſion</hi> of Parables is thus. In a Parable there are two Parts. The <hi>firſt</hi> is the Thing brought as a Similitude: the <hi>ſecond</hi> is the Application of that Thing, which is (as it were) the <hi>Marrow, Kernel</hi> or <hi>Myſtical Senſe</hi> of it. In Scripture we find three Sorts of Parables. (1) Some relate a Thing done and produced as a Similitude, as the Parable of the <hi>Leaven.</hi> (2) Some relate to a Thing not done, but of which there may be a Poſſibility or Probability; as the Parable of the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. (3) Others relate to a Thing impoſſible; as when the Trees <hi>went to annoint</hi> (or chuſe) <hi>themſelves a King,</hi> Judg. 9.8.</p>
               <p>More Examples of Parables reade in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.3, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.4, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.2, &amp;c. reſpecting the fourfold <hi>Seed</hi> —; the <hi>Tares</hi> —; and <hi>Marriage of the King's Son,</hi> Mark 13.34. <hi>The Man taking a far Journey.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt with good Reaſon uſed a Parabolical Way of Preaching —: theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons partly concern <hi>God, viz.</hi> a Fulfilling of the Scripture, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.34, 35. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.2. Or, ſecondly, <hi>Men,</hi> who are teachable and Godly (1) for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.33. <hi>John</hi> 3.12. (2) To excite and ſtir up a Fervor in them of being taught, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.7. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.10.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they are uſed to <hi>ſtubborn</hi> and unteachable Men, who deſpiſe the Word, to inform them, ſtir them up (peruſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.9. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25.) to check and convince them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.33, 40, 41, 43. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.43. See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.6, 7. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.39, 40, 41, 42. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <q>3. In Parables, if they be taken intirely, there are three Things, the <hi>Root,</hi> the <hi>Bark,</hi> and the <hi>Sap</hi> or Fruit. The <hi>Root</hi> is the <hi>Scope</hi> to which it tends. The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:39531:256"/> 
                        <hi>Bark</hi> is the <hi>ſenſible</hi> Similitude, and the <hi>Sap</hi> or Fruit is the <hi>Myſtical</hi> Senſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <q>In the right Explication and Application of Parables the Scope of them is principally to be heeded, <hi>viz.</hi> the Drift of the Spirit, which may be gathered from foregoing and ſubſequent Things, with which it has any Connexion.</q> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.30. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.31.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In Parables there is no neceſſity of being too ſifting and anxious about every ſingle Word, nor ought we to expect a too curious Adaptation or Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in every Part, to the ſpiritual Thing inculcated by it: but only to mind the Applicatory Part; as the Edge of a Sword is only deſigned to cut.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Parabolical Theology is not argumentative.</hi> That is, any Expoſition or Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of them beyond their Native Scope, or wherein the Interpretation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrees with the Analogy of Faith, or where it is ſuperſtitiouſly wreſted; this is like the <hi>wringing of the Noſe, till it brings Blood,</hi> Prov. 30.33.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It helps very much in the Underſtanding of Parables, if Men know the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Properties of ſuch Things, Arts or Myſteries, as are propoſed in the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. As what <hi>Treaſure</hi> is, what a <hi>Jewel</hi> or <hi>Pearl</hi> is, what <hi>Muſtard, Tares,</hi> &amp;c. are.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Whereas it is frequently ſaid, that <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is like this or that Thing,</hi> we are not to underſtand that it is ſo in all its Parts, or in every Reſpect, but only in ſuch Things as are declared in the Similitude. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>compared</hi> to a <hi>Thief</hi> only in this reſpect, becauſe he comes in a Time when unlook'd for, or when unexpected, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.39.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>All Parables do not conclude in the ſame, but in a different Manner.</hi> Some from Likeneſs <hi>(a ſimili)</hi> as the ſeven Parables, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. Some from Things unlike, as that of the <hi>unjuſt Judge,</hi> Him that deſired three Loaves, and the <hi>unjuſt Steward,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
